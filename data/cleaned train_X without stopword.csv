Indeed, cultivation plants may viewed earliest biotechnological enterprise. Agriculture theorized become dominant way producing food since Neolithic Revolution. Through early biotechnology, earliest farmers selected bred best suited crops, highest yields, produce enough food support growing population. As crops fields became increasingly large difficult maintain, discovered specific organisms by-products could effectively fertilize, restore nitrogen, control pests. Throughout history agriculture, farmers inadvertently altered genetics crops introducing new environments breeding plants — one first forms biotechnology. These processes also included early fermentation beer. These processes introduced early Mesopotamia, Egypt, China India, still use basic biological methods. In brewing, malted grains (containing enzymes) convert starch grains sugar adding specific yeasts produce beer."

This information useful, need compare information obtained healthy people without lung cancer. To this, need find healthy people characteristics (like age, gender, profession, hobbies, etc.) similar possible group lung cancer patients."
"In science, buoyancy (also known upthrust) upward force exerted fluid opposes weight immersed object. In column fluid, pressure increases depth result weight overlying fluid. Thus pressure bottom column fluid greater top column. Similarly, pressure bottom object submerged fluid greater top object. This pressure difference results net upwards force object. The magnitude force exerted proportional pressure difference, (as explained Archimedes' principle) equivalent weight fluid would otherwise occupy volume object, i.e. displaced fluid. For reason, object whose density greater fluid submerged tends sink."

"A chemical bond lasting attraction atoms enables formation chemical compounds. The bond may result electrostatic force attraction atoms opposite charges, sharing electrons covalent bonds. The strength chemical bonds varies considerably; ""strong bonds"" covalent ionic bonds ""weak bonds"" Dipole-dipole interaction, London dispersion force hydrogen bonding. Since opposite charges attract via simple electromagnetic force, negatively charged electrons orbiting nucleus positively charged protons nucleus attract other. An electron positioned two nuclei attracted them, nuclei attracted toward electrons position. This attraction constitutes chemical bond. Due matter wave nature electrons smaller mass, must occupy much larger amount volume compared nuclei, volume occupied electrons keeps atomic nuclei relatively far apart, compared size nuclei themselves."

"Civil law, civilian law, Roman law legal system originating Europe, intellectualized within framework late Roman law, whose prevalent feature core principles codified referable system serves primary source law. This contrasted common law systems whose intellectual framework comes judge-made decisional law gives precedential authority prior court decisions principle unfair treat similar facts differently different occasions (doctrine judicial precedent, stare decisis). Historically, civil law group legal ideas systems ultimately derived Code Justinian, heavily overlaid Napoleonic, Germanic, canonical, feudal, local practices, well doctrinal strains natural law, codification, legal positivism. Conceptually, civil law proceeds abstractions, formulates general principles, distinguishes substantive rules procedural rules. It holds case law secondary subordinate statutory law. When discussing civil law, one keep mind conceptual difference statute codal article."
"Civil rights rights people country have. The civil rights country apply citizens within borders. These rights given laws country. Civil rights sometimes thought natural rights. In many countries civil rights include freedom speech, freedom press, freedom religion, freedom assembly. Civil rights also include right property right get fair equal treatment government, citizens, private groups. They may prevent discrimination based race, sexual orientation gender. Civil rights protected law custom. The constitutions many democracies ""Bill Rights"" describes people's liberties rights. A well-known example United States Bill Rights. A court law decides person's civil rights violated. The courts also decide limits civil rights, people use freedoms take away rights people."
"Some large features Earth caused water. The Grand Canyon formed Colorado River. There many rivers big. There rivers much larger. The Mississippi River largest river U.S. Only Colorado formed large canyon. The Grand Canyon league. In cases, water harmless. Over time, water great effect. When water runs land wash soil away. With enough time, carve rock. Given enough time, create canyon mile wide. It hard believe water created Grand Canyon. Scientists learned Grand Canyon took long time form. Every time rained, water ran across ground. A little soil rock washed away every rainstorm. Water cause lot change time. Scientists unsure canyon's exact age. What know, old. A lot people visit Grand Canyon every year. They amazed size. Some people hike bottom canyon."
"The epidermis outer layer skin. There blood vessels, nerve endings, glands skin layer. Though may seem like it, layer skin active. It constantly renewed. How happen? The cells bottom layer always produced. The new cells slowly move surface. By time cells reach surface, died. It's true, outermost layer skin dead. Don't worry, forms protective layer. This outer layer even waterproof. Dead cells gradually falling off. As shed, replaced dead cells. The epidermis also contains cells give skin color. These cells produces brown pigment skin. Everyone's skin number cells. However, cells people darker skin produce pigment. The amount pigment depends two things. Some depends inherit parents. It also depends much sunlight strikes skin. The light hits skin, tanned get."
"Science shows hearing loss also affects cognitive skills (like thinking, learning, memory, attention). Babies hearing loss learn differently babies hear. This smart cannot things babies do. It world different someone hear. In study, wanted know born deaf affects visual processing. Visual processing way brains understand see eyes. It important cognitive ability. By studying visual processing deaf babies, learn hearing loss affects babies learn grow. To study visual processing, used something called habituation test. Habituation simple form learning comes exposed something many times. When babies become habituated something (like toy), lose interest it. This means brains processed information toy."
"Climate means usual condition temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, rainfall, meteorological elements area Earth's surface long time. Climate different weather. Weather condition elements right now, shorter periods time two weeks. The latitude, ground, height change climate location. It also important note oceans large bodies water nearby. Climates commonly classified temperature precipitation. The commonly used classification Köppen climate classification, first made Wladimir Köppen. The Thornthwaite system, used 1948, uses temperature precipitation information, evapotranspiration too. This makes useful studying many different kinds animal species are, things could happen climates change. The Bergeron Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus air masses help make climates come from."
"In Computer science, cloud computing describes type outsourcing computer services, similar way electricity supply outsourced. Users simply use it. They need worry electricity from, made, transported. Every month, pay consumed. The idea behind cloud computing similar: The user simply use storage, computing power, specially crafted development environments, without worry work internally. Cloud computing usually Internet-based computing. The cloud metaphor Internet based internet described computer network diagrams; means abstraction hiding complex infrastructure internet. It style computing IT-related capabilities provided ""as service"", allowing users access technology-enabled services Internet (""in cloud"") without knowledge of, control technologies behind servers."
"In February 1917, Tsar (King) Nicholas II Russian Empire overthrown people unhappy living conditions, especially World War I. The new government Russia democratic socialist government. Unfortunately, ineffective, people still unhappy. In November 1917, communist group called Bolsheviks led Vladimir Lenin overthrew new government. They supported groups workers called Soviets. The Bolsheviks created new communist government called Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (called simply Soviet Russia Russian SFSR). However, everyone supported communists. Many countries part Russian Empire left, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, Finland. The Russian Civil War began, Russian SFSR's ""Red Army"" fighting ""White Army"", group Russians communists. The White Army united organized. The Allied Powers World War I, United States, United Kingdom, France, invaded Russia support White Army."
"A collimator device narrows beam particles waves. To narrow mean either cause directions motion become aligned specific direction (i.e., make collimated light parallel rays), cause spatial cross section beam become smaller (beam limiting device). An English physicist Henry Kater inventor floating collimator, rendered great service practical astronomy. He reported invention January 1825. In report, Kater mentioned previous work area Carl Friedrich Gauss Friedrich Bessel. In optics, collimator may consist curved mirror lens type light source and/or image focus. This used replicate target focused infinity little parallax. In lighting, collimators typically designed using principles non-imaging optics."
"The Colosseum, originally known Flavian Amphitheatre, large amphitheatre city Rome. The construction Colosseum started around 70–72 AD finished 80 AD. Emperor Vespasian started works, Emperor Titus completed them. Emperor Domitian made changes building 81–96 AD. It seating 50,000 people. It 156 metres wide, 189 metres long 57 metres tall. It biggest amphitheatre built Roman Empire. The Colosseum first called Flavian Amphitheatre Latin, Amphitheatrum Flavium. This Vespasian Titus family name Flavius. It used gladiatorial contests, shows like animal hunts, animals would hunt eat prisoners; gladiators would fight animals. There also executions, plays, battle scenes; sometimes filled water fight sea battles. The people Rome could go Colosseum without costs; free."
"A compass instrument used navigation orientation shows direction relative geographic ""cardinal directions"", ""points"". Usually, diagram called compass rose, shows directions north, south, east, west abbreviated initials marked compass. When compass used, rose aligned corresponding geographic directions, so, example, ""N"" mark rose really points north. Frequently, addition rose sometimes instead it, angle markings degrees shown compass. North corresponds zero degrees, angles increase clockwise, east 90 degrees, south 180, west 270. These numbers allow compass show azimuths bearings, commonly stated notation. The magnetic compass first invented device divination early Chinese Han Dynasty (since 206 BC), later adopted navigation Song Dynasty Chinese 11th century."
"Computer hardware (or simply hardware computing contexts) collection physical elements constitutes computer system. Computer hardware physical parts components computer, monitor, keyboard, computer data storage, hard disk drive (HDD), graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, on, tangible physical objects. By contrast, software instructions stored run hardware. Software set machine-readable instructions directs computer's processor perform specific operations. A combination hardware software forms usable computing system. The template modern computers Von Neumann architecture, detailed 1945 paper Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann. This describes design architecture electronic digital computer subdivisions processing unit consisting arithmetic logic unit processor registers, control unit containing instruction register program counter, memory store data instructions, external mass storage, input output mechanisms."
"A computer program list instructions tell computer do. Everything computer done using computer program. A computer program written programming language. Some examples computer programs: A web browser like Mozilla Firefox Apple Safari used view web pages Internet. An office suite used write documents spreadsheets. Video games computer programs. A computer program stored file computer's hard drive. When user runs program, file read computer, processor reads data file list instructions. Then computer program tells do. A computer program written programmer. It difficult write ones zeroes machine code, computer read, computer programmers write programming language, BASIC, C, Java. Once written, programmer uses compiler turn language computer understand."
"A computing platform is, general sense, whatever pre-existing piece computer software code object designed run within, obeying constraints, making use facilities. The term computing platform refer different abstraction levels, including certain hardware architecture, operating system (OS), runtime libraries. In total said stage computer programs run. Binary executables compiled specific hardware platform, since different central processor units different machine codes. In addition, operating systems runtime libraries allow re-use code provide abstraction layers allow high-level source code run differently configured hardware. For example, many kinds data storage device, individual computer different configuration storage devices; application able call generic save write function provided OS runtime libraries, handle details themselves."
"A concentration camp (or internment camp) place government forces many people live. Usually, people belong groups government like. The government may think people enemies. In past, governments also put people concentration camps belonged certain religion, race, ethnic group. Usually, people sent concentration camps without trial found guilty crime. Sometimes, governments send people concentration camps forced labor killed. For example, best-known concentration camps run Nazi Germany World War II. The Nazis used concentration camps kill millions people force many others work slaves. However, many countries used concentration camps wars times trouble."
"Conservatism opposition rapid changes, promotes keeping traditions society. Gradualism one form. The first known use term political context François-René de Chateaubriand 1818. This period Bourbon restoration sought roll back policies French Revolution. The term associated right-wing politics. It used describe wide range views. There single set policies regarded conservative, meaning conservatism depends given place time. Conservatism tends support notion faith, particularly Abrahamic traditions countries main religions. In England, publication Edmund Burke's book Reflections revolution France. In book, suggested people satisfied, advocated caring government. The two ideas go together."
"A constellation group stars, usually recognizable shape pattern. When watched together time, stars look like picture. The word constellation comes Latin: con-, meaning together stella - meaning stars. Some examples constellations Ursa Major, Orion, Andromeda. There 88 constellations discovered far astronomers. People used constellations tell difference colors. Constellations also used group stars. Different places world may different constellations, today astronomy fixed set 88 constellations. This set based Greek set later southern constellations added, example Antlia - air pump. Most constellations names come Greek mythology, like Orion Andromeda. There 12 constellations Zodiac. The Sun travels Zodiac year. There also thirteenth constellation Ophiuchus - carrier serpent, Sun goes through. However, people think Zodiac."
"Copper used many ways one example wires. Copper used making wires easy stretch expensive. So that's large wire companies use copper cheaper takes less time get Copper may oldest metal use, old copper tools found. Copper used electrical wiring. It also shaped various parts. It used heat sink. The Statue Liberty made copper. It also used pipes carrying water, corrode. When people mix copper tin, bronze made. Bronze much harder, created Bronze Age. It became less important people learned use iron better. When zinc mixed copper, brass made, even harder bronze. Copper nickel makes cupronickel."
"Coral reefs diverse underwater ecosystems held together calcium carbonate structures secreted corals. Coral reefs built colonies tiny animals found marine waters contain nutrients. Most coral reefs built stony corals, turn consist polyps cluster groups. The polyps belong group animals known Cnidaria, also includes sea anemones jellyfish. Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons support protect coral polyps. Most reefs grow best warm, shallow, clear, sunny agitated waters. Often called ""rainforests sea"", shallow coral reefs form diverse ecosystems Earth. They occupy less 0.1% world's ocean surface, half area France, yet provide home least 25% marine species, including fish, mollusks, worms, crustaceans, echinoderms, sponges, tunicates cnidarians. Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though surrounded ocean waters provide nutrients."
"Covalent bonds chemical bonds two non-metal atoms. An example water, hydrogen (H) oxygen (O) bond together make (H2O). As non-metals—which need gain electrons—they share, outer shells cross order full outer shell. A full outer shell eight electrons. The electrons outer shell called valence electrons. The number valence electrons decided size atom. Electrons orbit atomic nucleus kind way planets orbit stars. There layers paths around atomic nucleus. The first layer always contains two electrons, layers usually contain eight. That say, wants number electrons outer-most layer high be."
"Creationism belief universe created way described religious books. According Genesis, God directly created life nothingness before, fixing chaos was. Other religions different Creation myths. The first approach known creatio ex nihilo, Latin name creation nothing. The idea God created world taught thousands years writers Augustine Hippo. Creationism known today started 19th century fundamentalist Protestants opposed theories scientists began put forward geology evolution. In 20th century, creationist movements also started Islam Judaism. Creationists believe today's living things came simple organisms changing evolving slowly time. They believe life created much today, one form life cannot change another. While biologists paleontologists say fossils different life see today, put order show changes time."
"The Crusades series religious wars fought Christians Muslims control Holy Land. Traditionally, took place 1095 1291. The Holy Land still place important three major monotheistic religions: Islam, Judaism, Christianity. There many important religious sites Holy Land. This land called Israel Palestine. Jerusalem, Nazareth, Bethlehem religious sites fell control Muslims Caliphate Omar (634-44). There many different crusades. The important biggest Crusades took place 11th century 13th century. There 9 large Crusades time. They numbered 1 9. There also many smaller Crusades. Some crusades even within Europe (for example, Germany, Austria Scandinavia). The smaller Crusades continued 16th century, Renaissance Reformation."
"A crystal crystalline solid solid material whose constituents, atoms, molecules ions, arranged highly ordered microscopic structure, forming crystal lattice extends directions. In addition, macroscopic single crystals usually identifiable geometrical shape, consisting flat faces specific, characteristic orientations. The scientific study crystals crystal formation known crystallography. The process crystal formation via mechanisms crystal growth called crystallization solidification. The word crystal derived Ancient Greek word krustallos, meaning ""ice"" ""rock crystal"", kruos, ""icy cold, frost"". Examples large crystals include snowflakes, diamonds, table salt. Most inorganic solids crystals polycrystals, i.e. many microscopic crystals fused together single solid. Examples polycrystals include metals, rocks, ceramics, ice. A third category solids amorphous solids, atoms periodic structure whatsoever. Examples amorphous solids include glass, wax, many plastics."
"Cuneiform script one earliest known systems writing. It used wedge-shaped marks clay tablets, made reed stylus. The name cuneiform means ""wedge shaped"", Latin cuneus ""wedge"" forma ""shape"". It came English usage probably Old French cunéiforme. It first used Sumer late 4th millennium BC (the 'Uruk IV' period). Cuneiform writing began system pictographs. In third millennium, signs became simplified abstract. Fewer characters used, 1,000 early Bronze Age 400 late Bronze Age (Hittite cuneiform). The system used combination phonetic, consonantal alphabetic (no vowels) syllabic signs. The original Sumerian script adapted writing Akkadian, Eblaite, Elamite, Hittite, Luwian, Hattic, Hurrian, Urartian languages, inspired Ugaritic Old Persian alphabets. Cuneiform writing gradually replaced Phoenician alphabet Neo-Assyrian Empire."
"In December 2019, several patients Wuhan, China reported suffering unknown viral pneumonia. Soon after, patients city diagnosed disease. On January 9, scientists identified new virus cause mysterious disease. They found new virus belongs class viruses called coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2. The name comes disease causes: severe acute respiratory syndrome; CoV stands coronavirus, number 2 added second coronavirus causes serious respiratory disease. Next, scientists examined DNA virus recovered sick person results surprising. They discovered new virus infecting humans similar coronavirus found bats (96% similarity). This outcome led think virus must jumped bats humans. But SARS-CoV-2 jump directly bats humans? Or first infect intermediate animal got humans? So far, questions remain unanswered, scientists seem agree SARS-CoV-2 jumped animal humans."
"Dark matter unidentified type matter comprising approximately 27% mass energy observable universe accounted dark energy, baryonic matter (ordinary matter), neutrinos. The name refers fact emit interact electromagnetic radiation, light, thus invisible entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although dark matter directly observed, existence properties inferred gravitational effects motions visible matter, gravitational lensing, influence universe's large-scale structure, effects cosmic microwave background. Dark matter transparent electromagnetic radiation and/or dense small fails absorb emit enough radiation detectable current imaging technology. Estimates masses galaxies larger structures via dynamical general relativistic means much greater based mass visible ""luminous"" matter."
"Because dark matter seem give reflect light, x-rays, radiation, instruments used find normal matter (like hot gas, stars, planets, us) can't find dark matter. It seems dark matter made thing matter see every day Earth. The way tell dark matter there, affects things ""see"" gravity. In 2006, group scientists claimed found way find dark matter. Since dark matter supposedly different normal matter, expected act differently. The scientists observed two far-away galaxy clusters crashed high speed: normal matter would scattered nearby collision, dark matter would not. By measuring gravity, able detect looked like two clouds dark matter, cloud normal matter (hot gas) them."
"Data visualization data visualization viewed many disciplines modern equivalent visual communication. It involves creation study visual representation data, meaning ""information abstracted schematic form, including attributes variables units information"". A primary goal data visualization communicate information clearly efficiently via statistical graphics, plots information graphics. Numerical data may encoded using dots, lines, bars, visually communicate quantitative message. Effective visualization helps users analyze reason data evidence. It makes complex data accessible, understandable usable. Users may particular analytical tasks, making comparisons understanding causality, design principle graphic (i.e., showing comparisons showing causality) follows task. Tables generally used users look specific measurement, charts various types used show patterns relationships data one variables."
"A database engine sort, change serve information database. The information stored many different ways - digital computers, card files, printed books methods used. Now data kept computer files. A database system computer program managing electronic databases. A simple example database system would electronic address book. The data database organized way. Before computers, employee data often kept file cabinets. There usually one card employee. On card, information date birth name employee could found. A database also ""cards"". To user, card look old times, time screen. To computer, information card stored different ways. Each ways known database model. The commonly used database model called relational database model; uses relations sets store data."

Distortions medium typically occur result, process either falls broader category of, frequently employed glitch art. The term databending derived circuit bending, objects children's toys, effects pedals electronic keyboards deliberately short circuited bending circuit board produce erratic spontaneous sounds. Like circuit bending, databending involves (often unpredictable) alteration target's behavior. Databending achieves alteration manipulating information within media file certain format, using software designed edit files different format; distortions medium typically occur result. Many techniques exist, including use hex editors manipulate certain components compression algorithm, comparatively simple methods."
"The Earth's warming climate reducing snow ice. The warming polar seas causes sea surface freeze less winter glaciers retreat, generating open, ice-free water. Less sea ice provides longer growing season marine plants called microalgae (phytoplankton) removes carbon, form carbon dioxide, atmosphere. The growth microalgae provides food animals eat algae store carbon growth bodies. The carbon stored marine life called blue carbon. When marine animals die blue carbon buried seabed, carbon removed carbon cycle. This trapping carbon seabed places called sequestration. The amount polar blue carbon increases climate warming. This known negative feedback climate change. Any negative feedback climate change important help combat global warming. In article explains learned measuring blue carbon."
"Decomposers organisms break dead decaying organisms, so, carry natural process decomposition. Like herbivores predators, decomposers heterotrophic, meaning use organic substrates get energy, carbon nutrients growth development. While terms decomposer detritivore often interchangeably used, however, detritivores must digest dead matter via internal processes decomposers break cells organisms using biochemical reactions without need internal digestion. Thus, invertebrates earthworms, woodlice, sea cucumbers detritivores, decomposers, technical sense, since must ingest nutrients unable absorb externally. The primary decomposers litter many ecosystems fungi. Unlike bacteria, unicellular organisms, saprotrophic fungi grow branching network hyphae. While bacteria restricted growing feeding exposed surfaces organic matter, fungi use hyphae penetrate larger pieces organic matter."
"An automated external defibrillator (AED) self-contained defibrillator device designed movable, easy simple use. They often shaped like briefcases carried handle. An AED contains battery, control computer, electrodes. When electrodes stuck onto patient, control computer assess patient, checking rhythm heart. It charge appropriate power level tell users person needs shocked. If patient need defibrillated, automated external defibrillator allow shock administered. A button must still pushed manually trigger shock, operator beforehand must certain nobody touching patient. Often, automated external defibrillators speakers give instructions opened. Current automated external defibrillator devices designed emergency medical technicians, home users, police security officers people minimal medical knowledge. These devices commonly found large gathering places, airports, casinos, sports stadiums, college campuses."
"Density measurement compares amount, ratio matter object volume. An object lot matter certain amount volume high density. An object little matter amount volume low density. Temperature effect density. When temperature substance increases, density decreases atoms moving around place less matter one space. When temperature substance decreases, density increases atoms move slower making atoms stay one place. Many substances follow rule, exceptions. Water one exception. When water freezes, makes ice less dense liquid water. Fresh water often used standard relative density. This called specific gravity. The common SI units density g/cm3 kg/m3. When numerator much larger denominator, means substance higher density. When denominator much larger numerator, substance lower density."
"Diarchy (or dyarchy, meaning ""I rule"") form government two individuals (""diarchs"") joint heads state. Most diarchs hold position life, passing position children family members. Diarchy one oldest forms government: examples include ancient Sparta, Rome, Carthage well Germanic Dacian tribes. Several ancient Polynesian societies also exhibited diarchic political structure. Ranks Inca Empire structured moieties, two occupants rank, different prestige, one hanan (upper) one hurin (lower). In modern usage, diarchy means system dual rule, whether government organization. Such 'diarchies' hereditary. Modern examples diarchies Principality Andorra, whose heads state President France Bishop Urgell; Republic San Marino, led two collegial Captains Regent; Kingdom Swaziland, joint heads state King mother."

Diaspora come refer particularly historical mass dispersions involuntary nature, expulsion Jews Judea, fleeing Greeks fall Constantinople, African Trans-Atlantic slave trade, southern Chinese Hindus South Asia coolie trade, Irish Irish Famine, displacement Palestinians 20th century exile deportation Circassians. Recently, scholars distinguished different kinds diaspora, based causes imperialism, trade labor migrations, kind social coherence within diaspora community ties ancestral lands. Some diaspora communities maintain strong political ties homeland. Other qualities may typical many diasporas thoughts return, relationships communities diaspora, lack full integration host country."
"A dictatorship country one person political party power whatever want. The ruler called dictator. In dictatorship, people usually many rights much freedom. Dictators come power number reasons social problems massive unemployment, inflation, unrest among population. Dictators normally backed powerful groups, landowners, private company owners, bank owners cases institutions like Roman Catholic Church put place law order force. This force generally directed poorer parts society, unemployed workers, ethnic minorities, working class areas shanty towns. Dictators normally need number things put place dictatorships: need get rid opponents (which may political religious) - imprisoned, exiled (sent outside country) killed. Dictators need prohibit (or allow) political parties oppose rule. They confiscate political parties' property offices things."
"But ""smart"" ""talented"" school? Research shown excelling school lot called executive functions. Executive functions set abilities help complex tasks, planning schoolwork, completing assignments, control emotions frustrations. One important executive functions called working memory. Working memory allows hold information mind perform mental operations, example, adding large numbers mind. Another important executive function inhibition, helps resist distractions temptations, example, temptation eat entire jar cookies. A third executive function cognitive flexibility, helps quickly shift attention back forth different tasks, like switching back forth homework YouTube feed. To measure executive functions, researchers designed number games played computer. It turns children better games also better school."
"Digital data, information theory information systems, discrete, discontinuous representations information works, contrasted continuous, analog signals behave continuous manner, represent information using continuous function. Although digital representations subject matter discrete mathematics, information represented either discrete, numbers letters, continuous, sounds, images, measurements. The word digital comes source words digit digitus (the Latin word finger), fingers often used discrete counting.

Humpback Whales Bowhead Whales named shapes backs heads. Omura's Whales Bryde's Whales named people. Each kind whale song. Just listen able tell singing! Each species different communities. They live different parts ocean. Each community songs. A blue whale Indian Ocean sing different song cousin Pacific. Just like humans speak several languages based from. Humpback whales excellent composers. They mix match several notes together. When listen carefully, tell humpback whale song made patterns many notes. Blue whales sing much simpler songs. Their songs consist note two."
"DNA, short deoxyribonucleic acid, molecule contains genetic code organisms. This includes animals, plants, protists, archaea bacteria. DNA cell organism tells cells proteins make. Mostly, proteins enzymes. DNA inherited children parents. This children share traits parents, skin, hair eye color. The DNA person combination DNA parents. Part organism's DNA ""non-coding DNA"" sequences. They code protein sequences. Some noncoding DNA transcribed non-coding RNA molecules, transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, regulatory RNAs. Other sequences transcribed all, give rise RNA unknown function. The amount non-coding DNA varies greatly among species. For example, 98% human genome non-coding DNA, 2% typical bacterial genome non-coding DNA."

It also extended unrelated people, major poets school various rosters single sports team."
"Earth planet live on. It third planet Sun. It planet known life it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It one four rocky planets inside Solar System. The three Mercury, Venus Mars. The large mass Sun makes Earth move around it, mass Earth makes Moon move around it. The Earth also turns round space, different parts face Sun different times. The Earth goes around Sun (one ""year"") every 365¼ times turns way around (one ""day""). The Moon goes around Earth every 27 days. As Earth goes round Sun time, changing light Moon takes 29½ days go dark bright dark again. That idea ""month"" came from. However, months 30 31 days fit one year."
"An earthquake (also known quake, tremor temblor) perceptible shaking surface Earth, resulting sudden release energy Earth's crust creates seismic waves. Earthquakes violent enough toss people around destroy whole cities. The seismicity seismic activity area refers frequency, type size earthquakes experienced period time. Earthquakes measured using observations seismometers. The moment magnitude common scale earthquakes larger approximately 5 reported entire globe. The numerous earthquakes smaller magnitude 5 reported national seismological observatories measured mostly local magnitude scale, also referred Richter magnitude scale. These two scales numerically similar range validity. Magnitude 3 lower earthquakes mostly imperceptible weak magnitude 7 potentially cause serious damage larger areas, depending depth."
"An ecosystem community living organisms conjunction nonliving components environment (things like air, water mineral soil), interacting system. These biotic abiotic components regarded linked together nutrient cycles energy flows. As ecosystems defined network interactions among organisms, organisms environment, size usually encompass specific, limited spaces (although scientists say entire planet ecosystem). Energy, water, nitrogen soil minerals essential abiotic components ecosystem. The energy flows ecosystems obtained primarily sun. It generally enters system photosynthesis, process also captures carbon atmosphere. By feeding plants one another, animals play important role movement matter energy system. They also influence quantity plant microbial biomass present. By breaking dead organic matter, decomposers release carbon back atmosphere facilitate nutrient cycling converting nutrients stored dead biomass back form readily used plants microbes."
"Edaphology (from Greek, edaphos, ""ground"") one two main divisions soil science, pedology. Edaphology concerned influence soils living things, particularly plants. The term also applied study soil influences humankind's use land plant growth well man's overall use land. General subfields within edaphology agricultural soil science (known term agrology regions) environmental soil science. (Pedology deals pedogenesis, soil morphology, soil classification.) In Russia, edaphology considered equivalent pedology, recognized applied sense consistent agrophysics agrochemistry outside Russia. Xenophon (431–355 BC), Cato (234–149 BC), early edaphologists. Xenophon noted beneficial effect turning cover crop earth. Cato wrote De Agri Cultura (""On Farming"") recommended tillage, crop rotation use legumes rotation build soil nitrogen. He also devised first soil capability classification specific crops."
"When go buy pet fish, probably get detailed instructions take care it. Even go home new buddy, know lot useful stuff, like eats often need clean tank. Now, tried adopt octopus, things would easy. I mean, even mouth? Scientists similar problem. When plan experiments using animals, need know lot tell whether experiments affecting them. Since scientists cannot hope learn everything every animal, decided study handful use well-studied examples research. These well-studied creatures called model organisms and, article, learn smallest them."
"The physical reasons elastic behavior quite different different materials. In metals, atomic lattice changes size shape forces applied (energy added system). When forces removed, lattice goes back original lower energy state. For rubbers polymers, elasticity caused stretching polymer chains forces applied. Hooke's law states force required deform elastic objects directly proportional distance deformation, regardless large distance becomes. This known perfect elasticity, given object return original shape matter strongly deformed. This ideal concept only; materials possess elasticity practice remain purely elastic small deformations, plastic (permanent) deformation occurs."
"Charge fundamental property forms matter exhibit electrostatic attraction repulsion presence matter. Electric charge characteristic property many subatomic particles. The charges free-standing particles integer multiples elementary charge e; say electric charge quantized. Michael Faraday, electrolysis experiments, first note discrete nature electric charge. Robert Millikan's oil drop experiment demonstrated fact directly, measured elementary charge. It discovered one type particle, quarks, fractional charges either -1/3 +2/3, believed always occur multiples integral charge; free-standing quarks never observed. By convention, charge electron negative, -e, proton positive, +e. Charged particles whose charges sign repel one another, particles whose charges different signs attract.

Essentially instrument consists head space sampling, sensor array, pattern recognition modules, generate signal pattern used characterizing odors. Electronic noses include three major parts: sample delivery system, detection system, computing system. The sample delivery system enables generation headspace (volatile compounds) sample, fraction analyzed. The system injects headspace detection system electronic nose. The sample delivery system essential guarantee constant operating conditions. The detection system, consists sensor set, ""reactive"" part instrument. When contact volatile compounds, sensors react, means experience change electrical properties. In electronic noses, sensor sensitive volatile molecules specific way."
"An electrostatic generator, electrostatic machine, electromechanical generator produces static electricity, electricity high voltage low continuous current. The knowledge static electricity dates back earliest civilizations, millennia remained merely interesting mystifying phenomenon, without theory explain behavior often confused magnetism. By end 17th Century, researchers developed practical means generating electricity friction, development electrostatic machines begin earnest 18th century, became fundamental instruments studies new science electricity. Electrostatic generators operate using manual (or other) power transform mechanical work electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop electrostatic charges opposite signs rendered two conductors, using electric forces, work using moving plates, drums, belts carry electric charge high potential electrode. The charge generated one two methods: either triboelectric effect (friction) electrostatic induction."
"Fleshy fruits high water content pericarp, fleshy mesocarp mature. This means fleshy fruits juicier dry fruits. The group fleshy fruits includes many fruits may find grocery store, many sweet fruits, peaches apples. Pomegranates, although eat seed fruit, also fall category, pericarp soft fleshy. Avocados, peaches, plums, fruits pits also fleshy fruits, thick fleshy mesocarp. Peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes also examples fleshy fruits, even though usually referred vegetables. In fact, edible fruits fall category fleshy fruits. These fruits use animals, birds humans, disperse seeds. Dry fruits hard dry fully mature. The pericarp dry fruits still three layers—exocarp, mesocarp, endocarp—but compared fleshy fruits, thinner much water."
"When animal dies, body changes appearance. It gradually disappear eaten animals bacteria. This process called decomposition. When sea turtle dies, first thing happens body turtle, known carcass, sinks bottom sea floor. However, bacteria intestines continue live produce gases, gradually making body swell. Like balloon filled air, body floats rises sea surface. But, bacteria continue decompose body, carcass eventually develop holes let gases kept surface. It sinks disappears bottom sea permanently. The turtles found stranded Virginia's beaches arrived floating. They yet released gases contained, otherwise would sunk remained bottom sea without reaching beach. Since ultimately wanted understand sea turtles died, first needed figure died."
"The Proclamation issued two parts. On September 22, 1862, Lincoln said 100 days, would free slaves areas Union control. On January 1, 1863, named ten states proclamation would apply: Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana. The five border states slavery still legal exempt, named, remained loyal Union rebellion. Tennessee also named Union forces already regained control there. Several counties Virginia process separating state form new state West Virginia specifically named exemptions, several parishes around New Orleans Louisiana. The next paragraph part quote Emancipation Proclamation."
"As newborn, spent time asleep awake. But older get, less sleep. It amount sleep changes development but, importantly, balance different sleep stages also changes. Generally, grow older, get less less slow-wave sleep, proportion light non-REM sleep increases. Scientists believe changes sleep may tell us brain's potential reconstruct itself. From infancy adolescence, brain undergoes major reorganization optimization deal daily needs experiences. New connections brain cells built, connections need removed, communication information along important neuron tracks speeds up. Crucially, specific part brain reconstruction, neurons region show slow rhythmic activity slow-wave sleep."
"An emulator computer program hardware makes one kind computer behave like different one, use programs things one. They best using old software games newer computers. They hardware add computer, software use it. Some types emulators require newer computers right system requirements. For example, need processor fast enough meet demands emulator. Memory (both RAM hard drive space) may another factor help run smoothly accurately. With advanced emulators, computer old, emulator even operating system may crash. The simplest type emulator called interpreter, runs foreign program one step time."
"Environment living things around them. It includes physical, chemical natural forces. Living things simply exist environment. They constantly interact it. Organisms change response conditions environment. In environment interactions plants, animals, soil, water, temperature, light, living non-living things. The word 'environment' used talk many things. People different fields knowledge (like history, geography biology) use word differently. An electromagnetic environment radio waves radiation magnetic fields. The galactic environment refers conditions stars. In psychology medicine person's environment people, physical things, places, events person lives with. The environment affects growth development person. It affects person's behavior. It affects person's body, mind heart."

Another example DNA polymerase. It reads intact DNA strand uses template make new strand. One example enzyme amylase, found saliva. It breaks starch molecules smaller glucose maltose molecules. Another kind enzyme lipase. It breaks fats smaller molecules, fatty acids glycerol. The proteases whole class enzymes. They break enzymes proteins back amino acids. Nucleases enzymes cut DNA RNA, often specific place molecule. Enzymes breaking large chemicals smaller chemicals. Other enzymes take smaller chemicals build bigger chemicals, many chemical tasks."
"The first attempts turn mature cells back pluripotent stem cells involved process called cloning. In cloning process, egg fertilized lab, right fertilization, DNA removed egg. The empty egg injected DNA another mature cell, skin blood cell. Even though DNA mature cell, environment egg basically reprogram genetic material mature cell, create embryo. If egg keeps developing, develop clone person animal mature cell taken. Human cloning illegal, early 1960's, English researchers successfully cloned frogs. Frogs relatively large eggs, easy work with. The researchers took fertilized egg frog, removed DNA, injected egg genetic material intestinal cell another frog. After 40 days, egg matured developed tadpole. The tadpole genetically identical frog intestinal cell taken."
"Temperature changes cause pieces rock flake away surface. Also, acid rainwater dissolves rocks containing calcium carbonate. These processes called weathering. Water erosion happens water moves pieces rock soil downhill. Waves also carry away small pieces material. A wave wash onto surface rock soil carry away pieces material flows back ocean lake. The size earth materials moved water depends fast water moving. A fast-flowing stream carry large rocks slow-moving stream might able carry small things like clay. Canyons among obvious features made erosion. Where river meets sea, drops solids, sometimes making river delta. Large tropical rivers like Paraná, Indus, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Zambezi, Mississippi Amazon carry huge amounts sediment sea. The Nile, perhaps world's longest river, carries much less sediment others because, part way, runs less fertile regions great rivers."

"Extinction one major features evolution. A species extinct members species still alive. All species become extinct sooner later. The end species may happen many reasons. It may caused habitat loss overhunted, major extinction event. An example animal extinct Dodo, over-hunting. Another quite different way species end species-splitting, known cladogenesis. Probably, none species living today living Cambrian period, ancestors were. endangered species may become extinct. A report Kew Gardens suggests one fifth plant species may risk extinction. Fossil species sometimes reappear millions years thought extinct. These cases called Lazarus taxa."
"You probably know many animals males females look different. Male lions, example, beautiful manes, lioness not. In birds, males tend beautifully colored, females not—just think ducks, chicken, peacocks. But know distinguish spider-men -women? Usually, female spiders bigger, well-fed. Females also different color males species, true species. You use another really safe trick identify male spider. In front four walking legs, spider males females another pair appendages, pedipalps. The pedipalps used many spider skills explained above, like feeding, sensing, catching prey, mating. And exactly tip pedipalps adult male spiders specialized organ, looks like boxing gloves."
"Fermentation metabolic process converts sugar acids, gases, alcohol. It occurs yeast bacteria, also oxygen-starved muscle cells, case lactic acid fermentation. Fermentation also used broadly refer bulk growth microorganisms growth medium, often goal producing specific chemical product. French microbiologist Louis Pasteur often remembered insights fermentation microbial causes. The science fermentation known zymology. Fermentation takes place electron transport chain unusable (often due lack final electron receptor, oxygen), becomes cell's primary means ATP (energy) production. It turns NADH pyruvate produced glycolysis NAD+ organic molecule (which varies depending type fermentation; see examples below). In presence O2, NADH pyruvate used generate ATP respiration. This called oxidative phosphorylation, generates much ATP glycolysis alone. For reason, cells generally benefit avoiding fermentation oxygen available, exception obligate anaerobes cannot tolerate oxygen."

Broadly defined, way structuring society around relationships derived holding land exchange service labour. Although derived Latin word feodum feudum (fief), use, term feudalism system describes conceived formal political system people living Middle Ages. In classic definition, François-Louis Ganshof (1944), feudalism describes set reciprocal legal military obligations among warrior nobility, revolving around three key concepts lords, vassals fiefs. A broader definition feudalism, described Marc Bloch (1939), includes obligations warrior nobility three estates realm: nobility, clergy, peasantry bound manorialism; sometimes referred ""feudal society""."
"Under feudalism, taxes paid money. They paid products services. Presents taxes given lords vassals. At harvest time, vassals gave shares crops lords. The vassals would grind grain noble's granaries. They would give part grain lord. When animals killed food, part meat given lords. The lords promised give protection, peace, safety vassals. Manors completely owned nobles. They given one generation another. The noble's firstborn son took father died. Each manor pasture lands, mill, wine press, church, village. A manor let many people live there. Lords gave servants food place sleep, pay servants money."

The dome, horizontal tilted, filled real-time (interactive) pre-rendered (linear) computer animations, live capture images, composited environments. Although current technology emerged early-to-mid 1990s, fulldome environments evolved numerous influences, including immersive art storytelling, technological roots domed architecture, planetariums, multi-projector film environments, flight simulation, virtual reality. Initial approaches moving fulldome imagery used wide-angle lenses, 35 70 mm film, expense ungainly nature film medium prevented much progress; furthermore, film formats Omnimax cover full two pi steradians dome surface, leaving section dome blank (though, due seating arrangements, part dome seen viewers). Later approaches fulldome utilized monochromatic vector graphics systems projected fisheye lens. Contemporary configurations employ raster video projectors, either singly grouped together cover dome surface full-color images animations."
"A fungus (plural: fungi) kind living organism: yeasts, moulds mushrooms types fungi. The fungi separate kingdom living things, different animals plants. Fungi cells nuclei. Their cell walls contain chitin, unlike cell walls plants, contain cellulose. These differences show fungi form single group related organisms, called Eumycota Eumycetes. They share common ancestor monophyletic group. Their basic mode life saprophytic: fungus breaks dead organic matter around it, uses food. Fungi reproduce sexually asexually. Some fungi grow mushrooms: fruiting bodies. Under cap gills; gills bear spores disperse, may develop new fungi. Otherwise, fungi use sporangium bear asexual spores mitosis, sexual spores meiosis. The spores haploid."

The seasons changed, seasons do. Winter rains pelted earth."
"At first, scientists thought brain could benefit listening music. They showed people's scores IQ tests improved listened classical music Mozart. This led people believe listening music makes smarter. But oversimplification overstatement results. Subsequent studies showed listening music actually make smarter, rather raises level enjoyment decreases feelings stress, sometimes result better focus improved test scores. This means that, music home classroom would automatically improve performance, could useful help focus new task situations increased attention decreased stress necessary. Further, listening music may different, perhaps smaller, effect actually playing music. This much way playing sports improve physical condition simply watching sports. Therefore, focusing power music could amplified playing along."
"In order infect host, parasites first find environment, this, develop call transmission strategies, ways finding successfully infecting host. Sometimes, parasites transmitted infected host consumed predator happens next host parasite. Then, parasite infects host life cycle continues. On occasions, luck involved, parasites actively increase chances transmission various ways. One common strategy influencing host's behavior, make contact next host easier. For example, parasite Gyrodactylus bullatarudis uses colorful guppy fish host, infecting gills changing fish swim. Healthy guppies meet infected ones attracted strange swimming behavior, caused infection parasite. In way, parasite infection spreads among healthy fish."

The rate sediment transport depends availability sediment river's discharge. Rivers also capable eroding rock creating new sediment, beds also coupling surrounding hillslopes. In way, rivers thought setting base level large-scale landscape evolution nonglacial environments. Rivers key links connectivity different landscape elements. As rivers flow across landscape, generally increase size, merging rivers. The network rivers thus formed drainage system. These systems take four general patterns: dendritic, radial, rectangular, trellis. Dendritic happens common, occurring underlying stratum stable (without faulting). Drainage systems four primary components: drainage basin, alluvial valley, delta plain, receiving basin. Some geomorphic examples fluvial landforms alluvial fans, oxbow lakes, fluvial terraces."
"So, exactly happens brain causes faster reaction times expected (attended) pictures activity described above? In humans, one powerful method used examine going inside brain record electrical activity produced brain active. Brain cells (neurons) send information one another using small electrical signals. These tiny electrical signals flow tissues across skull scalp, recorded using electrodes (small metal disks) attached scalp. Electrical devices called amplifiers boost tiny signals observe easily. This method called electroencephalography (EEG) recorded signals called electroencephalograms (EEGs EEG signals). The EEG signal produced activity thousands millions neurons brain, contains lots different electrical signals coming multiple different brain regions particular moment."

"Global warming slow steady rise Earth's surface temperature. Temperatures today 0.74 °C (1.33 °F) higher 150 years ago. Many scientists say next 100–200 years, temperatures might 6 degrees Celsius higher effects global warming discovered. The basic cause seems rise atmospheric carbon dioxide, predicted Svante Arrhenius hundred years ago. When people use fossil fuels like coal oil, adds carbon dioxide air. When people cut many trees (deforestation), means less carbon dioxide taken atmosphere plants. If Earth's temperature becomes hotter sea level also become higher. This partly water expands gets warmer. It also partly warm temperatures make glaciers melt. The sea level rise may cause coastal areas flood. Weather patterns, including much rain snow is, change. Deserts probably increase size. Colder areas warm faster warm areas."
"Globalization way local national ways things become global, is, done together around world. It economics trade, technology, politics, culture. People feel differently globalization: think helps everyone others think hurts people. It describes way countries people world interact integrate. Globalization many sides economic, political and/or cultural. Economic globalization countries coming together one big global economy, making international trade easier. In late 20th century, many countries agreed lower tariffs, taxes goods imported countries. The way Internet communication technologies makes easier people buy sell products around world example globalization. Herman E. Daly said important difference internationalization globalization. Internationalization nations working together goals. These things like treaties, alliances, international agreements. Globalization international trade less obstructed national borders."

Historians theologians identify three four waves increased religious enthusiasm occurring early 18th century late 19th century. Each ""Great Awakenings"" characterized widespread revivals led evangelical Protestant ministers, sharp increase interest religion, profound sense conviction redemption part affected, increase evangelical church membership, formation new religious movements denominations. The Awakenings resulted powerful preaching gave listeners sense personal guilt need salvation Christ. Pulling away ritual ceremony, Great Awakening made religion intensely personal average person fostering deep sense spiritual guilt redemption, encouraging introspection commitment new standard personal morality."
"The Great Depression great economic crisis started U.S. stock market crash 1929. The prices Wall Street stock market fell lot October 24 October 29, 1929. Many people lost jobs. By 1932, 25–30% people lost jobs. They became homeless poor. This ended wealth Roaring Twenties. Many people think Great Depression started Tuesday, October 29, economists think Black Tuesday one causes. From 1929-1932, depression worsened. Many suspect increased taxes American citizens increased tariffs (taxes countries trade United States) worsened it. Economist Milton Friedman said Great Depression worsened Federal Reserve printed less money usual. When Great Depression started, Herbert Hoover president United States, result, blamed it. People voted new president 1932. His name Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt got government pass many new laws programs help people hurt Great Depression."

"The greenhouse effect occurs certain gases Earth's atmosphere (the air around Earth) entraps infrared radiation. This makes planet become warmer, similar way makes greenhouse become warmer. The greenhouse effect caused greenhouse gases; important greenhouse gases Earth's atmosphere water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane. When greenhouse gas air, air holds heat. This greenhouse gases cause global warming. The greenhouse effect natural. It important life Earth. Without greenhouse effect, Earth's average temperature would around -18 -19 degrees Celsius (0 1 degree Fahrenheit). Earth would locked ice age. Because greenhouse effect, Earth's actual average temperature 14 degrees Celsius (57 degrees Fahrenheit). The problem recently, greenhouse effect become stronger. This humans using large amounts fossil fuels, release carbon dioxide burned."

"Hippocrates (c. 460 – c. 370 BC) Greek doctor called ""father medicine"". He first person write people got sick scientific reasons. People used believe disease caused angry (mad) gods. Hippocrates wrote treating sick people. His writings still important doctors today. He said many ideas doctors still study. An idea wrote ""patient confidentiality"". This means doctors cannot tell anyone else patients tell them. Another idea doctor cannot anything kill patient. These kinds ideas part medical ethics. The Hippocratic Oath named him. This promise oath doctors say. This means say said Hippocratic Oath. (People think Hippocrates write it.) Most medical schools today use new version. This means things changed. But important ideas same."
"An undergraduate history degree often used stepping stone graduate studies business law. Many historians employed universities facilities post-secondary education. In addition, normal colleges universities require PhD degree new full-time hires. A scholarly thesis, PhD, regarded baseline qualification professional historian. However, historians still gain recognition based published (academic) works award fellowships academic bodies like Royal Historical Society. Publication increasingly required smaller schools, graduate papers become journal articles PhD dissertations become published monographs. The graduate student experience difficult—those finish doctorate United States take average 8 years; funding scarce except rich universities. Being teaching assistant course required programs; others paid opportunity awarded fraction students."
"Writing history popular among Christian monks clergy Middle Ages. They wrote history Jesus Christ, Church patrons, dynastic history local rulers. In Early Middle Ages historical writing often took form annals chronicles recording events year year, style tended hamper analysis events causes. An example type writing Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, work several different writers: started reign Alfred Great late 9th century, one copy still updated 1154. Some writers period construct narrative form history. These included Gregory Tours successfully Bede, wrote secular ecclesiastical history known writing Ecclesiastical History English People."
"History study past events. People know happened past looking things past, including records (like books, newspapers letters) artifacts (like pottery, tools, human animal remains). Libraries, archives museums collect keep things people study history. A person studies history called historian. A person studies pre-history history things left behind ancient cultures called archaeologist. A person studies mankind society called anthropologist. The study sources methods used study write history called historiography. People learn past talking people remember things happened past. This called oral history.

The Robat moves ground using wheels and, future, aspire make tiny, flying, bat-like robot."
"In addition costing money, building also impact environment around it. These impacts often negative. For example, land house built cleared plants trees. Removing plants forces animals lived move, bad environment. The wood used construct walls collected equipment runs fossil fuels pollutes air. When roof gets replaced, old material taken landfill. And take care air conditioning system properly, fluids needed run harmful air breathe. Let us think even bigger single component. As may imagine, larger buildings, like factories, require maintenance house components. If factory five air conditioning units instead one, owners possibly track air conditioning unit needs replaced? The components make building cannot last forever."
"Zooplankton bite-sized, energy-rich snacks many predators, fish, whales, seabirds. These predators fast use eyes detect food, means effective hunting day sunlit surface water. However, zooplankton's food source, tiny plants known phytoplankton, also found surface water. So, zooplankton face dilemma: stay surface waters feed, risk eaten. If hide deep, safer, soon starve. This call tradeoff: option (to feed hide) brings gain, also cost. DVM zooplankton's clever solution balance tradeoff best both. Much like game hide-and-seek, zooplankton remain deep, dark waters daylight hours, sight predators. Under cover nightfall, migrate upwards mesopelagic layer epipelagic layer, graze relative safety darkness night."

One common misunderstandings genetic engineering belief changing DNA organism unnatural therefore wrong. However, Agrobacterium modifying DNA plants long humans learned it. This shows us changing DNA sequences natural process part world around us. By using Agrobacterium modify plant DNA, harnessing natural process develop crop plants need fewer pesticides, nutritious, yield food using less land. Using less land really important consideration because, want avoid destruction natural ecosystems, need make sure farms productive possible. Genetically engineered crop plants definitely help us grow food less land, meaning ecosystems protected."
"We experience weather. It changes seasons changes happening longer periods. This change average weather (and things too) called climate change. The air made different gases. One carbon dioxide, CO2. CO2 found naturally air also put things humans every day. For example, CO2 put air engines buses. It also put power stations produce electricity burning things like coal. When CO2 goes air, makes air warm up. This called global warming. Have greenhouse? Greenhouses glass buildings used grow plants. When sun shines greenhouse, sunlight makes warmer inside outside. Putting CO2 air similar effect putting world greenhouse. For reason, call gases like CO2 greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) ones act warm air, causing global warming. The well-known one carbon dioxide. (GHGs)."

Some moisture falls rain, quickly returned atmosphere tropical forest processes evaporation release leaves soil. Some water vapor come back rain right rainforest travel neighboring regions. Between 30 70% rainfall within Amazon basin consists water evaporated rainforest."
"Scientists found learning maths dealing multi-digit numbers easier children speak language clear number words. However, problem languages clear number words. What unclear number words look like? Have look words 97. In Basque (a language mostly spoken region north Spain), say ""laurogeita hamazazpi,"" means ""eighty-ten-seven"" (80 + 17). In French, say ""quatre-vingt-dix-sept,"" means ""four-twenty-ten-seven"" (4 × 20 + 10 + 7). The way number words constructed really complicated. In Hindi (one popular languages India), numbers people use subtraction rather addition build number word. For example, number 29 say ""unatis,"" means ""one thirty"" (30-1)."
"Fossils preserved remains traces living organism, plant animal. They tell us life Earth like hundreds, thousands even millions years ago! This fossil creature called ammonite. Ammonites squid-like creatures lived sea 400 million 65 million years ago. Paleontologists archaeologists scientists dig ground find fossils. When dug Himalayas, found lots ammonites. But fossils sea creatures end tallest mountains world? To answer question, go back hundred million years, Earth quite different. Back then, Earth two enormous continents: Gondwanaland Laurasia. Between gigantic Tethys Sea. Just beneath surface continents sea sits layer Earth called outer crust. This outer crust made large moving pieces called plates. Earth's plates almost 100 kilometres thick made solid rock. But underneath layer molten rock allows plates top move really slowly."

"Unfortunately, like many big crops, growing lot oil palms causes problems! Historically, oil palm often grown areas lots different species. Malaysian rainforests 2,000 species trees, Asian pygmy elephants, Malayan tapirs. Indonesian rainforests contain endangered animals like Sumatran tigers rhinos. Large areas rainforests converted oil palm plantations. Planting oil palms accounts 0.5% deforestation globally. In areas oil palm grown, crops responsible 50% deforestation. Laws set limit amount forested areas removed. For example, Malaysia laws, ""Protection Wildlife Act 1972"" ""Land Conservation Act 1960"" protect species reduce impacts environment. Also, growers members organization called Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) allowed clear forests areas contain high amounts biodiversity fragile ecosystems."
"Many scientific studies found that, making mistake, respond slowly next round. This might brain trying give time, avoid making mistake again. The stronger ERN error, slower response next round tends be. Some people larger ERN others. Does mean people sensitive making errors learn mistakes? Some studies seem support idea. For instance, Hirsh Inzlicht found stronger ERN associated better school performance. In study, researchers measured brain activity university students found students larger ERN also tended better grades. Having strong ERN necessarily always good thing, however. People anxious tend stronger ERNs, strong brain responses errors associated increased distractibility rather improved focus."

It manages working memory attention, way solve arithmetic problems involves multiple steps (procedural strategies). As get older start use fact retrieval, role frontal cortex changes. When look frontal cortex using fMRI EEG, see becomes less active get older."
"After decades research, language scientists found people's brains respond differently different kinds errors sentence. One way study brain's response semantic errors use electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG measures electrical activity always happening every part brain. To measure activity, scientists ask people wear special caps covered sensors called electrodes. The electrodes sit scalp measure electrical activity coming neurons (brain cells) right underneath electrodes. Scientists study electrical activity changes based volunteers doing. Scientists recorded EEG's volunteers read sentences semantic anomalies. In experiments, scientists asked volunteers read many sentences contain semantic mistakes. The scientists take average brain's activity volunteers read sentences. The averaged brain activity called event-related potential (ERP) waveform, like wave contains several high low points."

"A nomad (Greek: nomades; meaning one roaming pasture, pastoral tribe) member community people live different locations, moving one place another. Among various ways nomads relate environment, one distinguish hunter-gatherer, pastoral nomad owning livestock, ""modern"" peripatetic nomad. As 1995, estimated 30–40 million nomads world. Nomadic hunting gathering, following seasonally available wild plants game, far oldest human subsistence method. Pastoralists raise herds, driving them, and/or moving them, patterns normally avoid depleting pastures beyond ability recover. Nomadism also lifestyle adapted infertile regions steppe, tundra, ice sand, mobility efficient strategy exploiting scarce resources."
"When brain grows learns, connections different parts brain created. Over time, connections build networks. Networks different parts brain work together. Like well-trained musical group, brain networks help us learn skills like reading. While learn, cells brain (called neurons) connect reaching tiny arms (called axons) even growing new arms. Over time, many axons connect build long highways, called white matter tracts. These highways allow information travel one part brain another. Using MRI, scientists learned read different parts brain become active communicate learn. These brain areas funny-sounding names: occipitotemporal area, ""letter box"" brain (where process letters words); temporoparietal area (helps us play sounds language, figuring ""banana"" without sound /b/ ""anana""); inferior frontal region (the ""captain"" directs us). When brain areas talk often, highways become stronger."

"Plasma state matter. The three common states matter solids, liquids gases, plasma sometimes called fourth state matter. Plasma created adding energy gas electrons leave atoms. This called ionization. It results negatively charged electrons, positively charged ions. Unlike states matter, charged particles plasma react strongly electric magnetic fields (i.e. electromagnetic fields). If plasma loses heat, ions re-form gas, emitting energy caused ionize. Over 99% matter visible universe believed plasma. When atoms gas broken up, pieces called electrons ions. Because electric charge, pulled together pushed apart electric fields magnetic fields. This makes plasma act different gas. For example, magnetic fields used hold plasma, hold gas. Plasma better conductor electricity copper."

The commission also dictated expected nationality potential prize ships terms war. At sea, privateer captain obliged produce commission potential prize ship's captain evidence legitimacy prize claim. If nationality prize enemy commissioning sovereign, privateer could claim ship prize. Doing would act piracy. In British law, Offences Sea Act 1536, piracy act treason, raiding ship without valid commission. By late 17th century, prosecution privateers loyal usurped King James II piracy began shift legal framework piracy away treason towards crime property. As result, privateering commissions became matter national discretion."

"Protective tariffs tariffs enacted aim protecting domestic industry. Tariffs also imposed order raise government revenue, reduce undesirable activity (sin tax). Although tariff simultaneously protect domestic industry earn government revenue, goals protection revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing tradeoff two aims. A tariff tax added onto goods imported country; protective tariffs taxes render cost foreign import higher cost initially costlier domestic good. For example, piece cloth cost $4 Britain $4 United States, American government would impose tariff make price British cloth higher Americans. The underlying goal protective tariff protect domestic industry foreign competition."

Realism literature movement started Germany. The poet writer Heinrich Heine tried books accept world instead trying escape it. Realistic writers tried find good things society. The interest Realism led movement called Naturalism. This meant describing scenes nature accurately. The novelist Emile Zola Naturalist."
"Rebellion, uprising, insurrection refusal obedience order. It refers open resistance orders established authority. The term comes Latin verb rebellõ, ""I renew war"" (from re- (""again"") + bellõ (""I wage war/I revolt""). The rebel individual partakes rebellion rebellious activities, particularly armed. Thus, term rebellion also refers ensemble rebels state revolt. A rebellion originates sentiment indignation disapproval situation manifests refusal submit obey authority responsible situation. Rebellion individual collective, peaceful (civil disobedience, civil resistance, nonviolent resistance) violent (Terrorism, sabotage guerrilla warfare.) In political terms, rebellion revolt often distinguished different aims. If rebellion generally seeks evade oppressive power, revolt seeks overthrow destroy power, well accompanying laws. The goal rebellion resistance revolt seeks revolution."

"The velocity object rate change position respect frame reference, function time. Velocity equivalent specification speed direction motion (e.g. 60 km/h north). Velocity important concept kinematics, branch classical mechanics describes motion bodies. Velocity physical vector quantity; magnitude direction needed define it. The scalar absolute value (magnitude) velocity called ""speed"", coherent derived unit whose quantity measured SI (metric) system metres per second (m/s) SI base unit (m·s-1). For example, ""5 metres per second"" scalar (not vector), whereas ""5 metres per second east"" vector. If change speed, direction, both, object changing velocity said undergoing acceleration."
"Neuro-myths matter affect people's thoughts behavior: change see see other. Let us take example gender again. At age 8 9, difference well girls boys math, yet girls (and parents) rate math ability lower boys. This suggests people believe (in case, girls strong math) may real impact children see themselves, may turn affect actual performance. In one study, group college students given math test, men better women told test usually shows gender differences, told gender-fair test, women well men. This important because, end education, differences small become massive: 94% maths professors UK men . This good example careful neuro-myths—what believe brain brains around may come true."

"The body's first line defense viruses innate immune system. This cells mechanisms defend host infection. The cells innate system recognize, respond to, pathogens general way. RNA interference important innate defense viruses. Many viruses replication strategy involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When virus infects cell, releases RNA molecule. A protein complex called dicer sticks chops RNA pieces. Then biochemical pathway, called RISC complex, starts up. This attacks viral mRNA, cell survives infection. Rotaviruses avoid uncoating fully inside cell releasing newly produced mRNA pores particle's inner capsid. The genomic dsRNA remains protected inside core virion."
"Voltage force makes electricity move wire. It measured volts. Voltage also called electric tension electromotive force (EMF). It named Alessandro Volta. Technically, voltage difference electric potential two points. Voltage always measured two points, example positive negative ends battery, wire ground. As seen volt Hydraulic analogy, voltage seen pressure electrons move source. It directly proportional pressure exerted electrons. In words, higher voltage, higher pressure. For example, battery 3 volts exert pressure electrons twice hard battery 1.5 volts. The voltage push electrons component, like resistor, creating current. Usually, voltage current related formula."
"Voltage always measured two points, one often called ""ground"", zero volt (0V) point. In AC electrical installations connection earth. A connection made real ground water pipe, ground rod buried driven earth, convenient metallic conductor (not gas pipe) buried underground. This connection made point entry electric system building, every pole transformer street (often electric pole), places system. The whole planet Earth used reference point measuring voltage. In building ground carried electrical device two wires. One 'grounding conductor' (the green bare wire) used safety ground connect metal parts equipment earth. The used one electric conductors circuits system called 'neutral conductor'."

Often X width, Y height, Z length. Other 3D coordinate systems spherical coordinates include linear angular measurements."
"First, doctors must determine kind stroke occurred. This important type stroke requires different treatment. Using brain scanning devices, doctors must determine whether bleed blockage causing patients symptoms. If blockage (ischemic stroke) identified, goal treatment remove blood clot. (That treatments called clot-busters!) Clot-busting medications given patient break dissolve clot causing blockage. Alternatively, surgery performed wire sent blood vessel pull clot out. If bleed (hemorrhagic stroke) identified, goal treatment stop bleeding reduce pressure building within skull. A bleed commonly treated using medications reduce blood pressure bleeding brain. In cases, surgery may required drill hole skull release pressure brain. Another surgery option place clasp around broken part blood vessel clamp shut stop bleeding."
"Around 20,000 years ago, last cooling phase ended, starting warming period around 8,000 years ago, Earth's average temperature rose 5.6 8.5°F (3.1–4.7°C) . This means change around 0.06°F (0.03°C) every century. Between 8,000 years ago Industrial Revolution (around 200 years ago), temperatures relatively constant. Since then, temperatures increasing again, quickly. By 2100, scientists believe mean temperature planet raised additional 3.6–8.8°F (2.0–4.9°C) compared temperatures time Industrial Revolution . This means planet's temperature rise next century 100 times faster happened last 20,000 years. While past changes climate result several factors, like amount energy coming sun concentration different atmospheric gases, time humans mainly responsible. And call current warming anthropogenic (or human-induced) climate change."

Influenza viruses also change (or mutate) 1 year next, immune system recognize anymore, less able protect infection disease. This means that, every year, scientists need check flu viruses infecting people design new vaccines protect current virus strains . Each year, flu vaccines usually made mixture 3 4 strains match main circulating strains. Sometimes, new strains virus emerge completely different circulating virus strains. Scientists really worried threat new influenza viruses could pose human health. Some new flu virus strains could affect people seasonal flu cause global outbreak. We call strains pandemic strains."
"Reaction times quite different target shares some, all, features distractors. In case, target pop (""non-pop-out target""), reaction times go according number objects visual scene. Why happen? What simplest explanation types reaction time patterns? A critical insight came Treisman colleagues closely examined errors made observers. When observers misperceived target (for instance, reported odd-man-out red vertical bar, actually red horizontal bar, also likely misperceive target was. This means that, order find target correctly, one also perceive target correctly. Additional experiments showed mental ability focus particular location visual scene—say, bar top left corner image—is needed target pop out, needed does."

"Geometry kind mathematics studies size, shapes, positions things. There flat (2D) shapes solid (3D) shapes geometry. Squares, circles triangles simplest shapes flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones spheres simple shapes solid geometry. Geometry used measure area perimeter flat shape. It also used measure solid shape's volume surface area. Geometry used calculate size shape many things. For example, geometry help people find: surface area house, buy right amount paint volume box, see big enough hold liter food area farm, divided equal parts distance around edge pond, know much fencing buy."
"Geothermal energy (from Greek roots geo, meaning earth, thermos, meaning heat) energy made heat inside Earth's crust. It's clean sustainable. Although Sun heat surface Earth, heat inside Earth caused Sun. The geothermal energy Earth's crust comes 20% original formation planet, 80% radioactive decay minerals. The Earth hottest core and, core surface, temperature gets gradually cooler. Resources geothermal energy range shallow ground hot water hot rock found miles beneath Earth's surface, even deeper extremely high temperatures molten rock called magma. It used bathing Paleolithic times, better known making electricity. All world, geothermal energy used make 10 gigawatts electricity 2007, give 0.3% electricity needed around world. When used generate electricity, geothermal power plants typically offer constant output."
"We know exercise really important part care people living short- long-term mental illness. Exercise improve mood reduce symptoms mental illness, including depression anxiety. Exercise also improve sleep quality, increase energy levels reduce stress. Exercise also shown increase self-confidence improve memory concentration. Plus, exercise offers benefits without risk serious side-effects. It said that, exercise pill, would prescribed every patient every doctor. The benefits exercise ""transdiagnostic,"" meaning regardless mental illness someone may experiencing, everyone still gain benefits exercise. The benefits may differ little depending symptoms experienced. For example, someone depression, exercise may help improve sleep quality help provide motivation get bed, someone experiencing anxiety symptoms, exercise may act distraction constant worry."
"Thomas Edison made early phonographs 1870s. He originally used tin foil record sound. Soon wax cylinders used place tin foil. The cylinders could taken machine put back without destroying recording. Although discs made early 1888, 1902 discs became popular cylinder records. Discs first made shellac mixture, later polyvinyl chloride, often abbreviated ""vinyl"". Singles usually carried one two songs recordings. EPs (extended play records) carried three five songs. Albums carried many recordings; dozen normal, 30 45 minutes playing time. These formats still used today, digital recordings, playing time singles albums grown considerably. Vinyl records lost popularity never went production. Now, recent years vinyl gaining popularity, CD record shops gone business, vinyl record shops opening. Many argue higher sound quality vinyl compared newer formats."
"It common people think brain controls movements make. When think moving, signals travel brain travel spinal cord nerves (almost like telephone wires). The spinal cord acts like freeway many exits directions. In one direction, information senses travels brain, direction, signals carried brain control muscles. The actions muscles cause arms legs move. However, brain always required cause movement. By examining animals, scientists discovered complex groups cells within spinal cord control walking. It turns main job controlling walking done spinal cord, brain."
"Corals Red Sea handle higher temperatures, yet seem grow fine. The Red Sea warm sea compared places. There, summer temperatures reach 34°C, ocean waters may reach around 29–32°C. Interestingly, corals Red Sea living higher temperatures also higher salinity, amount salt water, example, seawater. You find range different salinities ocean, depending region. The Red Sea highest levels salt. Salinity measure amount salt water, Red Sea world's highest salt levels. That started wondering whether salinity could piece puzzle ability live high salinity one secrets strong Red Sea corals? To answer questions related coral bleaching, scientists often use coral model organism, means animal easier study corals time similar corals."
"During World War II, soldiers wounded battlefield great amount pain. The medical staff gave morphine, painkiller still used today. At point morphine began run out, soldiers left writhing pain. There seemed way helping them—but one nurses brilliant idea: collected empty morphine syringes, filled water, injected wounded soldiers. Amazingly, soon felt less pain! After war, one doctors seen brilliant nurse began study subject placebos. He made spectacular discoveries. It turns patients suffering diseases actually get better receiving placebo. Pain one problem responds well placebos. Like Band-Aid child's injury, placebos really ease pain, even pain surgery. Parkinson's disease patients, suffer uncontrollable movements, improve greatly get placebo pills. Asthmatic allergic people often respond well sugar pills inhalers contain active medicine."
"The human brain needs healthy proteins brain cells work function properly. There proteins get diets proteins produced inside bodies, tau protein. Tau proteins connecting pieces hold brain cells together. Imagine brain Lego city, thousands tall buildings, one representing brain cell. If head injury occurs playing sports, disrupts brain cell structures, like earthquake causing Lego buildings fall apart. Continuous hits shake brain cells, breaking smaller pieces creating mess call protein aggregates. When aggregates collect within cells, difficult tau protein function properly. Think traffic jam streets Lego buildings, caused fallen debris. Over time, larger protein aggregates collect breakdown brain cells. As people age, messes become severe Lego city brain cells brain longer function healthy way."

"Calcium present foods, notably dairy products, milk cheese, often found small fish vegetables. It known long time calcium beneficial strength bones. In addition, scientists discovered calcium also plays important role heart. The heart beats 2 billion times average person's lifetime circulate blood, needed provide energy every part body. The heart consists, among many things, 3 billion heart muscle cells squeeze together (""contract"") heartbeat together responsible pumping function heart. To make sure cell contracts right moment, heart uses electrical signal moves cell cell, much like wave stadium, activity one person activates neighbor. Research last decades revealed calcium particles responsible link electrical activation mechanical contraction. Calcium particles, electrical charge, enter heart muscle cells beat contribute electrical signal."
"Although sometimes cannot taste difference artificial real sugars (despite fact actually different), brains bodies react differences. Our bodies sometimes even detect small differences types sugars respond differently each. Artificial sweeteners highly concentrated—meaning physical amount, 200 13,000 times sweeter sugar! Even though artificial sugars sweeter real ones, nearly calorie-free. In studies, scientists even found people prefer taste artificial sugars real ones. However, also data suggest greater brain activation response real sugar saccharin (a common artificial sugar), effect particularly strong people hungry . Our brains bodies different responses artificial sweeteners sugars substances different one another level microscopic molecules. Reward pathways like racetracks neurons brains excited result release chemicals (such dopamine, common neurotransmitter) make us feel good."

"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly caused hit head due tackled playing sports, involved car accident, getting hit hard object. TBIs range mild severe, people quickly returning school sports others suffering permanent brain damage. The consequences TBIs considered invisible disability occur daily life, person outwardly appear problem, since need wheelchair, walker, crutches. For example, someone recovering TBI may dealing subtle changes mood, vision, sensations legs. Since many TBI symptoms obvious, cause others underestimate severe TBI be. People may think someone blaming bad grades injury occurred months ago exaggerating. Another misconception people recover TBIs quickly work harder school physical therapy. This true, TBI symptoms serious enough, participating therapy may challenging."
"Before dive talking brain injury, want introduce something scientists call Monroe-Kellie Doctrine, important understanding traumatic brain injury (TBI) happens. Think skull like suitcase. If packing trip, fit certain number items. So, pack many clothes, would able pack things, like favorite book. The Monroe-Kellie Doctrine states limited amount space skull hold cells make brain tissue, blood supplies oxygen tissue, special type fluid cushions brain, called cerebrospinal fluid. So, space limited, increase one three things, one two decrease. That means hit head brain swells, less room blood, could mean brain become even injured."
"All living things respire breathe turning food energy. Animals humans eat food breathe oxygen create energy breathe gas called carbon dioxide. When run, breathe much faster. Plants change energy get carbon dioxide taken leaves sunlight oxygen. Living things respond outside world. We call sensitivity. Humans make fires cold. Plants wilt get water. Elephants swim rivers hot. Living things babies survive. Fish, frogs birds lay eggs. Plants trees produce seeds make new plants trees. Humans babies. All living things eat food. Some animals eat grass, others eat meat. Vegetables need planted soil need sun water grow. Food gives us energy."
"During World War II, new technology developed allowed ships accurately measure water depths sailed across oceans. These single beam echo-sounders, instruments could attached hulls ships. An echo-sounder works sending sound signal, ""ping,"" water. This sound travels water reaches seafloor. When reaches seafloor, bounces reflects back ship, echo-sounder records reflected signal. So, name ""echo-sounder"" actually tells works—it sends ""sound"" (sounder) listens reflected sound, ""echo."" This basically thing happens stand big empty room make noise—the sound bounces walls hard surface, hear echo noise gets reflected back toward you. The time takes signal reach seafloor return ship used calculate water depth."
"Sometimes scientists want go beyond describing simple calculations like average heights age populations, understanding aspects populations complex. Let us say interested seeing much sleep students get, want know much test scores drop losing hours sleep. Effect sizes values estimate magnitude phenomenon, degree one variable (like hours sleep) impacts another variable (like test scores). For example, getting 3 hours sleep lowers test grade points compared get 9 hours sleep, might ""lose sleep"" losing sleep. While difference score, large difference. However, losing 6 hours sleep, drop many points test, could major impact grade. In case, would likely agree effect losing sleep grades important one."
"The immune system body's way protecting bad germs. The immune system uses many different strategies fight kill troublesome invaders. If become immunocompromised, meaning weak immune system, may able protect bad microbes. Most fungi infect people immunocompromised. Fungi also love growing plastics materials! These surfaces allow fungi form strong biofilms, communities fungi living protective shield blocks immune system attacking also prevents antifungals killing fungal cells living inside—think shield protects Wakanda movies Black Panther Infinity War. When fungi form biofilms, immune system drugs cannot penetrate shield! Fungi also leave biofilm travel parts body start new infection. Imagine fungus living biofilm growing inside catheter (IV tube) someone's vein. This catheter connected highway body, circulatory system."
"ChAOS scientists trying find answers questions, as: animals microorganisms living seafloor respond changes sea ice ocean processes? Will decline sea ice increase supply food seafloor ecosystems? How seafloor organisms change way recycle nutrients carbon seafloor ocean? And, amount carbon stored seafloor sediments change global climate change continues? The Arctic remote hostile realm, people ever venture. By burning fossil fuels, humans started huge environmental change region people permanently live. We expect major changes Arctic ecosystem, effects carbon burial, intensify planet heats further. Since changes polar regions affect every one us, matter live, crucial answer fundamental scientific questions, better understand effects immense environmental changes human civilization."
"As parasitic seedling gets closer host plant, experience shading effect host plant's leaves blocking sunlight. Whilst parasitic plant eyes, specialized proteins called phytochromes allow plant ""see"" different types light, determine full sunlight shaded conditions. This helps parasite prepare host contact invasion. Finally, parasite make contact host plant experience ""touch."" Many plants respond touch. For plants, however, touch associated danger. Touch could indicate plant insects landing leaves trying eat them. In case, plants use touch stop growth instead spend valuable energy resources defense. These plants make range toxic chemicals stop insects feeding them. Some plants also use touch trigger strengthening leaf cell walls, making harder insects eat them. For Cuscuta parasites, touch positive stimulus, telling parasite made contact potential host plant."
"You make pixels screen close screen made lot pixels. Similarly, galaxies bunch stars clumped together. Now galaxy phone screen, behave similar way. When galaxies close us, see bigger bumps coming galaxy due galaxies stars organized. Just like screen, galaxies farther away, stars blend together, galaxy look really smooth, similar way pixels screen blend together sit back it. When know size bumps, way stars organized galaxy, helps astronomers figure many stars galaxy has."
"The increase decrease power always comparison baseline situation. For instance, say alpha power decreases someone awake, would mean power lower compared person asleep–asleep would baseline. Another example: alpha power decreases see someone pain, would mean alpha power lower compared see someone pain. In example, brain's response person pain would baseline. Previous studies showed decrease increase alpha power different functions. However, scientists working figuring exact meaning changes alpha power. So, looking alpha rhythm informative better understanding brain operates different contexts. When seeing someone pain, brain respond alpha power increase (red circle) alpha power decrease (blue circle). But pain, brain respond either two activation types."
"Just cannot speak like humans do, mean fish cannot communicate using sound. Most fish listen environment many fish produce sounds communication. Fish use sound communicate shoal members, tell rivals strong are, tell potential mates want mate. Unfortunately, lot noise humans make underwater frequencies similar fish songs. To understand noise affects fish, studied sound-producing fish, painted goby (Pomatoschistus pictus). Painted goby males sing dance attract females nests, females usually pay attention males' song males' dance moves choosing mate. For females, especially important choose healthy strong male. Those males likely healthy strong children also take good care offspring. So, females choose good male also going good dad."
"In places temperature changes across seasons, winter coldest part year. During winter, many animals greatly reduce activity, often finding burrows retreats stay spring. However, retreats usually retreats born hatched. One exception turtles. Some adult turtles wait cold winter water ponds lakes may freeze over. Overwintering water problem young turtles, hard deal low levels oxygen (water <1% oxygen, air ~21% oxygen). So, overwintering underwater would work, hatchlings safely spend winter? In burrows, underground. But one problem. Turtle embryos resistant freezing. If gets cold, embryos still within eggs could die, hatchlings better chance surviving. For best chance survival, baby turtles hatch eggs (so would freeze) wait nests (to get enough oxygen) spring, weather warms emerge ."
"We know motor representations stored brain. But brain? One best ways answer question study patients brain damage. Previous studies shown motor representations familiar movements, like brushing teeth, located area brain called left parietal lobe. The parietal lobes located sides brains. They process sensations body, touch, movement, pain, temperature. They also important creating storing motor memories, well things discuss paper. Motor adaptation term use learning new movement skill. Motor adaptation found impaired two patients parietal lobe damage. One patient damage parietal lobes sides brain damage left parietal lobe. However, patient damage right parietal lobe examined, know left parietal lobe important right parietal lobe."
"Our daily internal clocks controlled genes, small units DNA passed parents. These genes contain code produce proteins—molecules body carry specific jobs. Some genes control internal clocks produce proteins called ""activators"" others produce proteins called ""suppressors."" Activators proteins turn gene on, whereas suppressors proteins turn gene off. In daily internal clocks, need two activators bind together turn gene. This gene usually turned morning. Once gene turned on, lots different proteins made, including two suppressors. When lots suppressor proteins made, typically feel energetic lively! Throughout day, concentration suppressor proteins increases bodies. By evening, enough suppressor proteins made block activators turn gene. While sleep, suppressors bloodstream break down. During breakdown, occurs nighttime, feel tired sleepy."
"As adult, I might learn new actions taking dance class trying sport I never done before. Learning new actions unusual, people, day-to-day actions different done past. On hand, babies constantly learning new things. They discovering new objects, learning move new ways, playing new toys. You probably remember, baby, started able move hands arms much control reached new toys played them. Within first year life, babies learning lots things themselves, also figuring people things."
"Humans apes share ancestor, means follow branches generations parents humans apes back far enough, come animal (our shared ancestor). Humans like chimpanzees bonobos like apes, closer Tree Life. The three species–humans, chimpanzees, bonobos–share ancestor. Humans became different species bonobos chimpanzees 5–7 million years ago. Bonobos chimpanzees continued become even humans branched them. Chimpanzees bonobos also changed millions years, ways. We study behavior animals alive order learn likely behavior ancestors. If species branch tree life learn skill, probably inherited skill shared ancestor. If one species branch learn skill, shared ancestor probably able learn skill."
"Autistic people talked camouflaging while, doctors researchers still know much it. No one knows whether camouflaging help people actually causes autistic people problems. Researchers started learn camouflaging asking autistic people experiences camouflaging masking, hiding aspects pretending like someone else. For example, person might mask autism pretending join game even understand rules. Autistic people reported camouflage autism want make friends form connections people, camouflaging helpful them. Some people might camouflage autism school work, people treat differently concentrate do. Some people camouflage autism meet new people, make good impression maybe become friends. Some people stop camouflaging get know someone well, think person accept even act autistic."

The first passive mechanical hand developed used German knight Gottfried ""Götz"" von Berlichingen sixteenth century. Active prostheses allow user grasp objects, using specific movements body without help another hand. There two types active prostheses: body-powered externally powered. Body-powered prostheses, invented nineteenth century, usually attached body harness. The hands hooks end opened closed body movements, like stretching arm. These prostheses made plastic, metal, fabric straps harness. Externally powered active prostheses widely used since 1960s. They called ""externally-powered,"" need external power source, battery. These types prostheses complex robotic hands arms sometimes see movies computer games. These prostheses made plastics, metal, many electrical components, like motors microprocessors."
"When two animals species mate, offspring get 50% genes parent. This makes look like mixture parents. Hybrids crosses two difference species, contain 50% genes parent species. A famous hybrid mule, cross donkey horse. Fifty percentage mule's genes horse 50% donkey. Because mixing, mules features parent species strong, like donkeys, well intelligent, like horses. Farmers breed mules combination makes mules excellent carrying supplies. Using hybridization combine desirable aspects parent species beneficial humans, hybrids often used farming. Many delicious fruits buy grocery store even created hybridization! Bananas, grapefruit, carrots, cucumbers hybrid species. There actually hundreds banana varieties, us familiar hybrid banana. Farmers kept mixing varieties bananas create perfect combination soft, tasty fruit without many seeds."
"Plants exposed attackers ground, also face difficulties ground. The zone surrounding roots plant little community called rhizosphere, empty neighborhood! The soil around roots full microorganisms. Of microorganisms, establish give-and-take relationships roots plants. One group soilborne organisms called arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), abbreviate AMF. How could community rhizosphere help plant host? Well, free move grab nutritious snack go doctor prescriptions feel sick. Plants cannot walk, depend roots search water nutrients. Roots limited length, course, plants look sources help, including AMF. AMF fungi (related mushrooms) similar appearance roots enable plant's roots reach nutrients required growth. The structure AMF much finer plant roots though, fungi able absorb minerals efficiently plant."

In fact, found evidence cobweb spiders 65% rooms sampled. Spiders good surviving long periods time without food live less-than-ideal environment houses provide. Spiders predators become accustomed homes. House centipedes, ""thousand-leggers"" may even terrifying people. These many-legged arthropods thrive indoors humidity right."
"Many interactions species winners losers: one individual benefits, one suffers. These called negative species interactions. For example, predation type species interaction one organism (a predator) eats another organism (the prey)—this good predator bad prey! Different ant species eat many different things, ants important predators. Predatory ants often eat insects like termites caterpillars, ants eat plants fungus. Megaponera ants one food—termites—and ants organize huge hunts worker ants infiltrate termite colonies, capture many termites carry, bring termites back ant nest feed larvae. But even though many ants predators, also prey animals. Lots animals like eat ants: birds, ant eaters, even humans parts world! An animal eats ants called myrmecophagous animal. The authors paper eaten ant larvae specially prepared, confirm delicious nutritious."

They put glue doll's body. The next day, animals went farm saw doll. They decided return thought doll would catch them. The doll frightened animals, except rabbit. It returned following day."
"There girl named Ayanda. Ayanda child parents. Her mother father wanted separate. Ayanda decided run away home. She went forest know else go. A wolf forest chased Ayanda, climbed tree. The wolf tried bite her, climbed higher. At top tree, Ayanda saw beautiful sun. She fell love sun decided stay forest. Ayanda climbed tree every day talk sun. The sun became family. One day, Ayanda saw man tree. The man father. Ayanda came tree father explained there. He said, ""Long born, mother I would meet here. It special place."" ""Now I climb tree get peace mother I fight,"" said Ayanda's father. After while, Ayanda's mother also came forest. She came make peace Ayanda's father. This peace tree."
"Mythology refer collected myths group people—their body stories tell explain nature, history, customs. It also refer study myths. A myth story true. The definition word myth still subject debate. Myths may old, new (for example: urban myths). There may records proof happened, least parts myths may true. We know older people telling younger people. Some myths may started 'true' stories people told re-told them, may changed parts, less 'true'. They may changed mistake, make interesting. All cultures myths. Stories Greek Roman gods goddesses myths. Many people believed mythological animals gods. These animals gods may control power part human natural life. For example, Greek god Zeus powers lightning storms."
"The tropical ocean contains little food nutrients. Like life desert, life tropical ocean difficult organisms. Yet, coral reefs colorful oases full life middle marine desert. How millions species call coral reefs home? All organisms living play roles recycling small amounts food nutrients available. Because nothing ever truly wasted, coral reefs flourish marine desert hardly food. Although coral reefs existed planet long dinosaurs, facing serious problems today. Warming oceans harm corals, leading loss coral reefs. However, corals northern Red Sea resistant warm temperatures. Some scientists believe Red Sea reefs may able survive even reefs disappearing elsewhere around world."
"Nutrition provides cells organism food, form use. Organisms need food able keep bodies working properly. They also need food able certain things. Malnutrition happen person eat right amount nutrients. They get better changing diet right amount various nutrients. Different organisms different food requirements, eat different things order meet requirements. Animals eat meat, example, get certain nutrients like protein foods. A nutrition expert called dietician. Nutritionists different need government recognize experts. Anyone call nutritionist. The six main types nutrient carbohydrates, fats, minerals, protein, vitamins, water. A macronutrient nutrient needs eaten lot. A micronutrient, vitamin, needed smaller amounts still important. Carbohydrates needed body people eat lot them."
"Paleontology study fossils living things, phylogeny (evolutionary relationships). It depends basic sciences zoology, botany historical geology. The term paleobiology implies study investigate paleoecology groups question. In paleozoology, evolution phyla fossil records studied: see List animal phyla. In paleobotany, fossil plants studied. In historical geology formation, sequence dating rock strata give information past environments. A fossil kind life ten thousand years old preserved form study today. The fossil record always incomplete, later discoveries may extend known survival group. See Lazarus taxon. Some paleontologists study fossils microorganisms, living things small see without microscope, paleontologists study fossils giant dinosaurs."
"A parliament type legislature. The famous parliament probably one United Kingdom, sometimes called ""Mother Parliaments"". The word ""parliament"" comes French word parler, means talk. The Althing, national parliament Iceland, founded earlier (930 AD), oldest legislature world still existing. However, Althing function legislature four centuries, role primary legislature modern. The Parliament United Kingdom split three separate parts, House Commons (the lower house), lords (the upper house) Monarch. Most legislative power concentrated House Commons. It made 650 Members Parliament (MPs). These people elected people United Kingdom represent House Commons. The leader political party commands majority MPs usually made Prime Minister, Head State, position reserved Sovereign."

How active parts brain get fresh supply oxygen? The blood carries oxygen, blood vessels, brain. There protein blood called hemoglobin holds onto oxygen carries places need energy. When hemoglobin holding onto oxygen, called oxygenated hemoglobin, hemoglobin holding oxygen, called deoxygenated hemoglobin. When area brain active, oxygenated hemoglobin starts displace deoxygenated hemoglobin. When part brain active, hemodynamic response. A hemodynamic response happens blood vessels active areas brain become wider."
"The brain works like computer, multiple networks connecting brain regions responsible different functions. We complex systems every function. For example, one brain network responsible acquiring managing data comes senses, another responsible creating managing emotions, another responsible movements, another responsible creating, managing prioritizing thoughts. In OCD, communication system parts brain, namely orbitofrontal cortex basal ganglia, disrupted brain makes mistakes processing prioritizing information. The orbitofrontal cortex responsible using information senses make decisions anticipating result life choices. In OCD, region hyperactivated detects errors dangers anything wrong."
"Social networks tell us something people them. When somebody difficult situation, use little help friends. Who friends Frozen? That difficult tell watching movie, study another kind social network—the network talks whom. This network exactly friendship network, much easier accurately determine talks movie decide exactly friends strong friendships are. In network conversations, Anna speaks nine people, suppose nine friends. Mathematicians say Anna node network, degree nine, nine friends neighbors. Similarly, Elsa degree eight, eight friends; Kristoff degree six. Calculating somebody's degree one way measure importance, also many ways."

The second stage use separate characters wood carving casting. This done 11th century China Korea. It failed really successful, structure Chinese written language, shared time Korea, thousands characters. Because this, method significantly better copying scribes. Printing reinvented 15th century Europe. Development slow Johannes Gutenberg made several improvements. In following century print became main means communication people wished record knowledge. With alphabetic system writing, print much economical copying, permitted many times many copies available readers. This revolution information technology helped aspects life Europe, time Europe becoming dominant region world."
"Radar machine uses radio waves echolocation find objects aircraft, ships, rain. The basic parts radar are: The transmitter creates radio waves. The antenna directs radio waves. The receiver measures waves bounced back object. By this, radar locate object. Radar used many different ways. It measure speed number cars road, amount water air, many things. Radar first used 1904 Christian Hülsmeyer. He given patent radar (Reichspatent Nr. 165546). It became commonplace World War II. The word RADAR created 1942 acronym Radio Detection Ranging. This acronym replaced British initialism RDF (Radio Direction Finding). The word thought many people regular word, longer acronym."
"Reptile common name one main groups land vertebrates. It used much biologists, use accurate terms. The name ""reptile"" comes Latin means ""one creeps"". All living reptile species cold blooded, scaly skin, lay cleidoic eggs. They excrete uric acid (instead urea) cloaca. A cloaca shared opening anus, urinary tract reproductive ducts. Reptiles also share arrangement heart major blood vessels different mammals. Many important groups reptiles extinct. The great marine reptiles Mesozoic era, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs mosasaurs, extinct. We used say dinosaurs extinct, survive form feathered descendants (birds). Ancient reptiles survive include turtles, crocodiles Tuatara, lone survivor group. The great majority present-day reptiles snakes lizards."

By convention gateway lowest IP address (like phone number computer) subnet (a group addresses). Anytime make connection (such connection www.wikipedia.org) computer looks IP address using look-up service called DNS (Domain Name Service). Once destination address found computer connects gateway router. The gateway sends data router ISP (Internet Service Provider), router said part internet connects routers data reaches destination. In small networks homes, small businesses (including internet cafés) small schools, router also performs NAT (network address translation) makes outgoing connections look like come one address."
"Have heard methane gas? Maybe word methane familiar you, fact, gas widely found daily lives, atmosphere, solar system. Methane gas naturally produced kinds environments, comes breakdown organic (formerly living) materials. Methane gas effective trapping heat also burns easily. So, methane one important fuels humans. Additionally, methane atmosphere helps regulate climate Earth. However, amount methane atmosphere steadily increasing past 200 years, concerns scientific community. Surprisingly, recent studies indicated levels methane regulated tiny microbes. In article, encourage learn methane cycle, microbes make eat methane, research needed gas."

Wildlife trade diverse includes species plants, fungi, kinds animals, reptiles, birds, mammals, amphibians, fish, insects. There many reasons species traded. The common reasons wildlife traded traded plants animals used food, medicine, pets, create luxury items, souvenirs, jewelry, clothing, furniture. In parts world, people depend wildlife reasons. For species occur high numbers, wild populations animals usually affected much people use ways. Some species wild animals relatively easy breed captivity. The offspring (meaning babies) captive bred animals traded. This often case furbearing animals, kept bred captivity fur pelts made clothing, coats hats."
"Responding stress way described positive thing. In fact, essential. Without stress response, T. Rex would probably eat us. But, think it, many times lives stressed T. Rex (or predator, matter) going eat us? We much likely stressed ongoing non-physical worries. Social relationships, performance school work, unknown trying something new; things likely stress us daily basis. These also situations increased heart rate blood flow muscles particularly useful all. In cases, known chronic stress (because lasts long time), stress response actually bad you."
"Many genes undergo changes, called mutations, which, cases, make person likely get certain diseases. Diseases caused mutations genes X chromosome called X-linked diseases. Remember, males experience XCI one X chromosome. So, males disease-causing gene X chromosome, active likely cause disease. However, XCI helps protect females X-linked diseases. Imagine girl healthy copy gene one X chromosome mutant copy gene X chromosome. If X chromosome mutant copy turned due XCI, X chromosome healthy copy stay active express gene properly. This mean would get sick, increase chances getting diseases related mutant gene."
"Even nice weather conditions, rip currents flow offshore channels quickly, sometimes speeds 2 (2.2 yards) second, fast Olympic swimmers! This means even gentle rip currents take swimmers abilities long way offshore. A rip current easily move someone length football field 1 min. What makes currents dangerous feel anything, going flow. It realize suddenly long way safety beach things get scary, people start panic. When people panic, often try swim back beach current and, that, risk use energy."
"Deep-ocean hydrothermal vents occur intense volcanic activity. Seawater permeates rock, heats becomes enriched substances rock, like metals, sulfide, dihydrogen, methane. Mineral-rich chimneys, around hydrothermal-vent animals live, form heated fluids exit seafloor. During 1980s, scientists realized habitats supported unusual type primary production, fueled sunlight photosynthesis, energy reactions chemicals found hydrothermal fluid, like sulfide, oxygen present seawater. Amazingly, basic, single-celled microorganisms use energy build parts one cell. Hydrothermal vents provided first evidence process, called chemosynthesis, could sustain much life otherwise desert-like surroundings. But larger animals live environments? How get energy need survive? Well, many animals acquire energy maintaining close relationships chemosynthetic bacteria. This type relationship, two different organisms live together closely called symbiosis. In chemosynthetic symbioses, organisms involved believed benefit relationship."

Seismology done seismologists geophysicists using devices pick vibrations called geophones, hydrophones seismometers. Seismology either passive, listening vibrations caused earthquakes volcanic activity, active, using small explosive charges send vibrations ground. Seismic detectors come two types, one measures vibrations, one measures side side vibrations. Both types use arrangement magnet coil wire convert vibrations electrical signal stored computer analysis. Seismologists find location earthquakes plotting received vibrations map. They also pick underground nuclear tests, many seismic recording stations set for."
"Ivan Pavlov physiologist studying digestive system dogs, noticed dogs would begin drool (or ""salivate"") ordinary things happened around time food coming. Pavlov found could train dogs drool following particular cue, like sound bell, presenting cue giving dogs food. Over time, dogs would begin drool heard cue rather received food. This process limited dogs. For example, go ice cream shop lot smells like strawberries, eventually might come form mental link ice cream smell strawberries. The smell strawberries becomes cue could cause start salivating thought ice cream. This process forming mental links environmental cues something highly motivating, food like, called classical conditioning. Scientist found classical conditioning also happens drug addiction."
"Every soil different amounts sand silt clay. The mix sand silt clay ""texture"" soil. We also say mix ""soil texture"". A soil lot sand called ""sandy soil texture"". A soil lot silt called ""silt soil texture"". A soil lot clay called ""clay soil texture"". Farmers like grow food best soil. The best soil half sand silt little clay. The organic matter found soil counted soil texture. Only rocks counted discover soil texture. Soil texture important. Clay humus special parts soil. They help keep water plant food (plant nutrients) soil. Water plant nutrients stick clay humus. Water sticks rock soil. But water sticks best clay. Water taken (absorbed) humus like sponge absorbs water. Humus holds lot water plant nutrients."
"In modern politics, state association control geographic area territory. States seen three main pieces: A territory A people Some institutions (which power make rules). There different forms government state have, example republic monarchy. Sometimes states form countries. At times many states work together form country (like United States). Most states also armed forces, civil service, law police. The earliest states groups power. A group farms working together group factories working together could 'states' since people control protect them. More organized states could monarchies early Egypt Pharaoh. Following larger military-based states Roman Empire. The important early states, however, Ancient Greek states freedom, writing democracy."
"Almost 3.5 billion years ago, humans, trees, even dinosaurs, living things Earth single cells. As years passed by, cells reproduced, divided filled planet lots single cells. They lived land sea, stayed really small millions millions years. But sudden, creatures made many cells started appear. Today see ""multicellular"" species around us. Just look around you—there cats dogs, horses, lizards, mushrooms, trees. You even see look reflection … world full them. But wait, beginning time simply single-celled creatures then, suddenly, became multicellular creatures? What? What happened? What makes single cells form multicellular creature?"
"What makes epilepsy seizures mysterious? Ancient people understand seizure was. They saw people would unexplained changes behavior, understand why. Some people thought gods spirits involved seizures. The Romans called epilepsy sacred disease, thinking gods talked people seizures. In Middle Ages, people believed seizures caused demon inside body invisibly ""seized"" person. Hence name seizure. Fear spread quickly soon people believed even breathing air epileptic patient could let demon travel people. Therefore, people seizures isolated restrained. Their ""doctors"" priests tried send demon away. Not treatments unhelpful, could also dangerous patients. To provide right treatment, doctors needed know cause epilepsy. In Middle Ages, know know now. Today know seizures happen brain. The brain responsible almost every aspect behavior. The brain detects scents, creates feelings, holds memories."
"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) one common brain disorders children. TBI often occurs due strong blow head getting hit object, running object, falling one's head. TBI dangerous severely damage brain, critical controlling body personality, well speech, movement, much more. Depending part brain hurt, serious consequences. Because this, important able diagnose TBI soon happens. When brain damaged, consequences injury serious. However, studying brain difficult, brain enclosed skull. Therefore, hard tell whether injury severe is. Currently, common way look inside brain process called imaging, several types images giving us different insights brain."
"The Sumerians made clothing using natural resources available them. Clothing made wool flax Sumerians could raise harvest. How thick coarse clothing related season worn. Heavier clothing worn winter, lighter clothing summer. Men bare-chested wore skirt-like clothes tied waist. Women usually wore dresses covered shoulders ankles. The right arm shoulder left uncovered. Men either clean shaven long hair beards. Women wore hair long, usually braided wrapped around heads. When entertaining guests, women placed headdresses hair. Although rich poor Sumerians wore style clothing, richer Sumerians wore clothing made expensive luxurious materials. Rich women princesses also wore clothing colorful bright."
"The term supersonic used describe speed speed sound (Mach 1). At normal temperature like 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 °C), speed needed something traveling faster sound speed 344 m/s, 1,129 ft/s, 770 mph 1,238 km/h. Speeds faster 5 times speed sound sometimes called hypersonic. Speeds parts air around object (like propeller) reach supersonic speeds called transonic (normally somewhere Mach 0.8 Mach 1.2). It hard reach supersonic speeds, drag increases lot near speeds. This slows plane, years made control difficult. These problems called ""sound barrier"". Jet engines developments solved problems middle 20th century."
"Primates, like humans, mammals. Around ten twelve million years ago, ancestral primate lineage split speciation one common ancestor two major groups. These two lineages evolved separately become variety species see today. Members one group early version know today great apes (gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos Africa, orangutans Asia); is, modern great apes evolved ancestral group. They mostly remained forest arboreal lifestyle, meaning live trees. Great apes also quadrupeds means move around four legs ground. The group evolved different way. They became terrestrial, meaning live land trees. From quadrupeds, evolved bipeds, meaning move around two back legs. In addition, size brain increased. This group that, evolution, gave rise modern current humans. Many fossils found Africa genus named Australopithecus (which means southern ape)."
"Viscosity physical property fluids. It shows resistance flow. In simple example, water low viscosity, 'thin'. Syrup tar, hand high viscosity, 'thick'. A way test viscosity speed substance runs slope. Syrup would reach bottom slowly, whereas water would lot quicker. There two types viscosity: dynamic viscosity, measured pascal seconds, kinematic viscosity, measured meters per second squared. Viscosity used way predict volcanoes erupt. When lava comes thickly (viscous), chance erupt violently. This lava hard time getting may burst can. If lava thin (low viscosity), flows like water. The word viscous comes Latin viscum, meaning sticky."
"Voice Internet protocol (or VoIP) term used number protocols used carry voice data packet switched networks. Beforehand, telephony used dedicated line, allocated call, time call. This known PSTN (or ""public switched telephony network""). Using VOIP reduce costs, ""dedicated line"" telephony (and fax) longer needed. There number technical problems must solved first, though: Carrying voice data needs service guarantees (mostly form ""throughput"", ""response time""). Not result loss signal (or ""hiccups"") Most telephony network provide possibility operate phone, even power lost area. This done emergency calls still made. VOIP usually provide possibility. The LAN used voice data becomes single point failure. If problems LAN, also affect VOIP calls."
"A wind turbine rotating machine transfers kinetic energy wind mechanical energy. If mechanical energy used directly machinery, pumping water, cutting lumber grinding stones, machine called windmill. If mechanical energy instead converted electricity, machine may called wind turbine generator (WTG), wind power unit (WPU), wind energy converter (WEC), aerogenerator. The wind turbine's blades turned wind. This turns shaft turning slowly, 10-20 rpm high torque. The shaft goes reduction gearbox ratio 1:50, although wind turbine gearboxes ratio 1:100 more. Some wind turbines may reduction gearbox ratio 1:1. The gearbox turns generator quickly, around 1000 rpm, low torque. The generator creates electricity. This electricity combined wind turbines may wind farm. This combined electricity may used locally adjusted match electricity power grid sent power grid."
"Nowadays, humans Earth belong group, usually call ""modern humans."" But 30,000 years ago, human groups existed parallel us. The well-known Neanderthals. Neanderthals lived tens thousands years Europe, Asia Middle East. At time, modern humans evolved Africa. The two groups met modern humans started exit Africa spread across continents. The nature encounters two human groups still mystery, final outcome well-known—we still around, Neanderthals went extinct long ago. The Neanderthals overall similar us, still exhibited differences. For example, lower slightly elongated skull, slightly bigger brain, protruding face, bigger teeth, wider bones, indicating robust us. All seen many Neanderthal skeletons found along years. In fact, many know related skeleton, skeletal parts survive death much better tissues."
"Wayan lived small village sea. The people believed died, returned sea. The sea special place ancestors live. Wayan's father grandfather fishermen. Most men village fishermen, always way. Every morning sunrise, men went fishing jukung boats. Every evening sunset, came back boats full fish. Wayan learned fish everything changing fishermen. There fewer fish, always small. Sometimes, boats came back empty, even though sea day. The beaches also changed. They always polluted, plastic trash thrown sand. When tide went out, washed plastic sea. Gradually, people village began get sick. They could get well. One day, Wayan fishing, storm blew over. He swept waves. A turtle saved him. ""I Bintang. I help you, climb onto back,"" said turtle. ""Maybe help me. My grandfather sick one knows do."""

"Gaining weight pregnancy important health mother child. However, baby, mother keeps extra weight gained pregnancy, harmful long-term health. This study tested whether Internet weight-loss program could help mothers lose weight baby. We worked WIC, program gives low-income families food support. Half women study received regular WIC half received WIC plus Internet weight-loss program. We found Internet program helped mothers lose five pounds regular WIC, also helped mothers get back weight pregnancy. WIC serves half US mothers; Internet weight-loss program WIC could help many women get closer weight pregnancy avoid weight-related diseases later life."
"Importantly, symmetry breaking plays role way group individuals eats pizza, also determines patterns behavior individuals show perform kinds tasks. For example, two individuals walking directly toward sidewalk, person moves left right first defines direction movement second person. This something us experienced everyday life. Of course, us also experienced happens symmetry broken: awkward back-and-forth dance approaching walker rapidly move left right time. In situation, cases social (and individual) behavior, symmetry breaking important effective organization behavior performance; symmetry breaking defines individuals move together harmony. So, understanding symmetry breaking influences human behavior social interactions provides deep insights groups individuals share environmental space together (such crosswalk, workspace playground)."
"The air breathe composed lots different chemical components. Some components pollutants harmful human health. Air pollutants come variety different sources, including power plants, factories, agriculture, transportation. Transportation vehicles powered combustion fossil fuels, gasoline diesel, move one place another, combustion fuels results release gases small particles. These substances known ""pollution emissions."" Different types transportation emit different amounts air pollutants, impact local regional air quality. Both trucks trains used transport freight United States. Understanding freight trucks trains impact air quality useful learn ways reduce pollution harmful human health."
"In particular year, dry season long, drought hit hard. As result, rivers dried up, except River Blessings. All animals thirsty called meeting. Camel first speak, ""As know, thirsty rivers dried up, except River Blessings. But far away. What do?"" Horse suggested, ""Some us go River Blessings. We drink bring water others."" Cow answered, ""It far. By time returned river left behind would dead."" Sheep said, ""Maa! Maaa! I go River Blessings drink water."" Goat jumped said, ""Meee, meee! I also go River Blessings."" Chicken said, ""Keer, ker ker ker! I go River Blessings. All animals wanted go. Camel led way. Going easy. Guinea fowl last line. ""My friends, I longer go River Blessings,"" said."
"As result, Amazonia big rivers act like water vapor bombs, put water atmosphere form dense layer clouds contain large amounts water. These clouds flow winds, forming incredible flying rivers. Because high temperatures Amazonia large amount rain falls around equator, Amazonia massive power exchange water forest atmosphere. The 4,000-m high Andean cordillera west South American continent acts barrier winds clouds coming across continent Atlantic Ocean. The result massive amount rainfall areas central, eastern, southern Brazil neighboring countries. This river clouds transports billions liters water vapor form year, almost equal amount water flowing Amazon River ocean year. So, rivers sky change climate continent and, eventually, whole world."
"When go art gallery, usually details artworks written labels walls. These labels specially prepared experts give us opinions art objects. We thought people believe written labels, wanted understand powerful opinions could be. So, put people brain scanner measure brain responses received different opinions pictures. For research, used portrait paintings famous Dutch artist Rembrandt. Sometimes, told viewers portrait genuine Rembrandt sometimes told portrait fake. When analyzed brain responses, interesting responses found people told paintings fake. Two parts brain, one involved strategic planning (called frontopolar cortex) one involved vision (called occipital cortex), seemed work together people thought paintings fake."
"Inside every cell bodies long, thin molecule called DNA. DNA personal instruction manual tells body everything needs know! DNA determines eye color, skin tone, tall are, even whether muscles better sprinting running marathon. Just like real instruction manual, instructions DNA written series letters. In DNA, four letters–A, T, G, C. These letters combined spell instruction proteins. Proteins building blocks cells. Your brain, heart, organs made lots different proteins. The DNA letters needed make one protein referred ""gene."" Can guess many genes human has? Over 20,000!"
"An antenna aerial metal device made send receive radio waves. Many electronic devices like radio, television, radar, wireless LAN, cell phone, GPS need antennas job. Antennas work air outer space. The word 'antenna' Guglielmo Marconi's test wireless equipment 1895. For test, He used 2.5 meters long pole antenna tent pole called ' l'antenna centrale ' Italian. So, antenna simply called ' l'antenna '. After that, word 'antenna' became popular among people meaning today. The plural antenna either antennas antennae (U.S. Canada tend use antennas places). Each one made work specific frequency range. The antenna's length size usually depends wavelength (1/frequency) uses."
"You probably realized languages change time. They change slowly subtly, may noticed changes. Your parents may use old-fashioned words friends would never use. For example, want say something really good, may say dope phat. Instead, parents may say awesome wicked … grandparents, groovy hip! However, vocabulary changes time. All aspects language, sounds, grammar, words sentences used conversation, change time. Have ever read original version Shakespeare's plays? If have, found many strange words phrases. For instance, Act 2, Scene 2 Romeo Juliet, Romeo praises Juliet's beauty saying: ""But wait, what's light window there? It east, Juliet sun."" However, Shakespeare actually wrote (and people period would said) was: ""But soft! What light yonder window breaks? It east, Juliet sun."""
"What wanted understand experiments different patterns two wing surfaces created. But, go there, let us talk wings patterns develop butterflies currently know process. Butterflies, along beetles, flies, moths, wasps, fall category holometabolous insects. This means butterflies go complete metamorphosis, transition larval, grub-like animal adult animal wings, large slender legs, big eyes. Butterflies four different life stages development. These embryonic stage (which takes place inside egg), larval (or caterpillar) stage, pupal stage, adult stage. Eggs laid leaves specific plants caterpillars hatch eggs eat leaves enter pupal stage. The pupal stage larval body tissues dissolved re-formed create adult butterfly finally emerges. The wings butterflies formed group cells set aside embryonic stage, form imaginal discs."
"Confusion important step learning school, also important learning are. Psychologists call sense identity. Your identity involve part groups like race, gender, subcultures. Identity also made values goals. People figure identity two steps. The first step exploration, try different groups values see fits. The next step commitment, decide firmly parts identity. Exploring identity feel confusing. You might afraid people judge going different phases committing group. But phases completely natural. A study published International Journal Behavioral Development found people exploring better outcomes higher self-esteem later life. Confusion gives us space try new things creative. Allowing confused ask questions leads deeper understanding, learning, higher self-confidence. So, try embarrassed confused something."
"Big memory software hardware approach facilitates storing/retrieval/processing large data sets (terabytes higher). The term akin big data instances form big data processing architecture implemented memory rather disks/storage. Different caches one usage big memory. The computer memory, namely RAM, works orders magnitude faster hard drives even solid state drives, usually due higher raw data throughput tighter coupling CPU RAM chips (wider bus, CPU RAM usually installed motherboard). Locality reference another important characteristic caches fast access. The price computer memory chips significantly declined since late 2000s, 2015 affordable 256 gigabytes RAM server. Currently, many vendors solid software big memory solutions plentiful hardware options (i.e. cheap RAM planks). Terracotta developed ""in-memory data management suite"""
"A capacitor (also called condenser, older term) electronic device stores electric energy. It similar battery, smaller, lightweight charges much quicker. Capacitors used many electronic devices today made many different types material. The Leyden jar one first capacitors invented. Capacitors usually made two metal plates top near other, actually touch. When powered, allow energy stored inside electrical field. Because plates need lot area store even small amount charge, plates usually rolled shape, cylinder. Sometimes, shapes capacitors used special purposes. A capacitor-like effect also result two conductors close other, whether want exist not."
"In capitalism, people may sell lend property, people may buy borrow it. If one person wants buy, another person wants sell them, need get permission higher power. People market (buying selling other) without anyone else telling to. People capital sometimes called capitalists (people support capitalism called capitalists, too). They hire anyone wants work factories, shops lands pay offer. The word capital used mean things produce things money. For example, lands, factories, shops, tools machines capital. If someone money invested, money capital too. In capitalist systems, many people workers (or proletarians). They employed earn money living. People choose work anyone hire free market."

Eucalyptus trees poisons leaves prevent animals eating them, koalas! Now cool characteristic superhero! But survive nothing poisonous leaves? Well, turns special microbes tummies koalas work really hard break poisonous parts leaves smaller pieces cannot hurt koala. Most microbes koala's tummy hanging out, good example commensalism. This means microbes helping break poisons, hurting koalas either. One microbe break leaves, Lonepinella koalarum, important poison-fighting sidekick forms mutualism koalas. Scientists still learning microbes serve sidekicks koala superheroes."
"Sofia told us experience memory game. However, everyone same, cannot sure game work someone else. Therefore, important test game large group people. This called using large sample size. A sample scientific word group included study—because sample population. Although cannot ask every person world take part study, using large sample size helps us make sure results find true one person. If sample large enough good example whole population. If brain-training game helps many people group get better remembering, sure game work people general. Also, using large sample size means result find likely real, true result; study done one person, could coincidence training worked them."
"Neurons cells contained within brain spinal cord specialize communicating information within body. Neurons important many things including moving, breathing, thinking, feeling pain. If cells injured due accident, example, body longer perform important functions. As result, person become disabled way. To help patients injuries brains spinal cords, scientists doctors may able replace damaged neurons transplanting new cells injured person. By using new cells replace neurons lost injury, possible patients recover lost abilities, moving. Scientists think stem cells ideal cell type transplant injured patients, stem cells multiply change different cell types needed repair injury. The stem cells researchers transplant made lab skin cells blood cells. Skin blood cells obtained using needle."
"As Industrial Revolution gained speed, factories sprang one city another. These factories drew many workers countryside cities. Thousands people lived according age-old rhythms planting harvesting began live according new rhythms modern factory. By late 1800s, Industrial Revolution spread beyond Great Britain. It spread across body water called English Channel Europe across Atlantic Ocean United States. It also begun enter new phase development. Great Britain taken lead first phase Industrial Revolution, featured steam power, coal, cotton manufacturing. During second phase, featured steel, electricity, oil, gas, United States took lead. Like great changes human history, Industrial Revolution positive negative results. Generally speaking, Industrial Revolution improved lives millions making great variety goods affordable widely available. Most importantly though, Industrial Revolution provided new kinds employment opportunities people. But industrialization also less desirable consequences."
"Our ears complex anatomical structures separated three main parts, called outer ear, middle ear, inner ear. The outer ear visible part ear primarily used funneling sound environment ear canal. From there, sound travels middle ear, vibrates eardrum three tiny bones, called ossicles, transmit sound energy inner ear. The energy continues travel inner ear, received cochlea. The cochlea structure within ear shaped like snail shell, contains Organ Corti, sensory ""hair cells"" present sense sound energy. When cochlea receives sound, amplifies signal detected hair cells transmits signal auditory nerve brain. While ears responsible receiving sound environment, brain perceives makes sense sounds. The auditory cortex brain located within region called temporal lobe specialized processing interpreting sounds."

"As fruit-bearing plants grow, fruits accumulate water nutrients plant, use nutrients create flesh seeds. Most growing fruits initially provide protection developing seeds. At stage, fruits generally hard unattractive predators—including us! After seed development fruit growth, properties fruit change make fruit attractive potential consumers, animals, birds, humans. These changes include common ways judge whether fruit ripe not, including external features, softness touch, internal features, sweetness. Fruits also change color ripen. This happens breakdown green pigment called chlorophyll, along creation accumulation pigments responsible red, purple, blue hues (anthocyanin), bright red, yellow, orange hues (carotenoids), name few."
"Trees lot like people: experience stress get infected bugs diseases attacked fire, windstorms, floods, droughts. We call things attack infect trees disturbances. Trees like people, cannot go doctor get better cannot move away whatever disturbing them.

As may imagine, different kinds trees evolved different ways deal certain disturbances. This learned research area called Pine Barrens New Jersey East Coast United States."
"Every living thing needs food, also known nutrients. In nature, living things connected food webs. Food webs show us animals plants related feeding relationships, like birds eating fish. But nutrients get returned back food web? The answer bacteria! Bacteria impossible see naked eye. But found almost everywhere world important recycling nutrients within habitats, like river. Scientists use DNA bacteria figure bacterial species present different bacterial species recycle nutrients river. Knowing species present helps scientists use bacteria monitor changes river habitats. These changes might include amount food available larger animals. Bacteria considered base, foundation, food web, paying attention early changes bacteria may allow us prevent extreme changes causing problems later larger creatures."

This group plants also includes grasses grow land, lilies (seagrasses' closest relative), palms. Seagrasses roots, veins, leaves. Seagrasses, like plants, special food producers inside cells, called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts use energy sun convert carbon dioxide water sugar oxygen growth, process called photosynthesis. Veins inside seagrass tissue transport sugar oxygen around plant. The veins also contain air pockets, called lacunae, help keep seagrass leaves floating water. Seagrasses roots rhizomes (thicker stems), extend sediment leaves. The roots rhizomes absorb store nutrients help anchor seagrass plants (and sediment) place. Seaweeds, however, much less complex seagrasses, flowers veins."
"Volcanologists study personality volcanoes information determine far volcanoes eruptions impact—remember rocks Phlegrean fields found 4,000 km away! Now, tell different hazards associated volcanic eruptions. When volcano erupts explosively, magma cools turned volcanic ash gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2) sulfur dioxide (SO2). The ash travels fast injected far atmosphere, high planes travel. Volcanic ash stop planes flying, ash bad engines. Volcanic ash gas large eruptions travel atmosphere around Earth, changing climate. Volcanic gases form aerosols (mixture fine particles) atmosphere reflect solar radiation back space lead global cooling. In fact, one eruption Indonesia 1815 caused year without summer Europe North America 1816."
"Although anyone, kids elderly, come contact bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis, vast majority people (about 90%) infected bacterium eliminate work immune system. However, people (about 10%) come contact M. tuberculosis cannot fully control bacteria. These people develop disease called active tuberculosis (ATB), fever, coughing, weight loss. In cases, M. tuberculosis makes home within lungs transmitted people sick people expel bacteria coughing. In people, another scenario occurs immune system keeps bacteria dormant ""sleeping"" state. This called latent TB. In people, fever, coughing, weight loss apparent immune system stops working properly."
"We classify spiders hundred families, like jumping spiders, crab spiders, wolf spiders, ogre-faced spiders, bird-eating spiders (which also known tarantulas), primitively segmented spiders. Some spiders good camouflage—the art disguise. Often, colors camouflaged spiders blend nicely environment, spiders lot protect themselves. Some, example, difficult tell apart ants, disguise makes safe predators dislike stinging ants. Tropical orb weavers lots different shapes. Some look like leaves, others like twigs, bark, even bird droppings order fool predators. Other spiders may protect armor. Spiny orb weavers, example, various thorny projections predators want avoid. Some spiders show flashy colors intended warn predators kind prey meddled with. Recently, discovered orb-weaver spider tropical forests China whose abdomen resembles green leaf dried-up leaf time."
"An antibiotic compound kills bacteria. Antibiotics stop essential cell activities allow bacteria live. For example, antibiotics harm cell wall, prevent bacteria reproducing. The first antibiotic, penicillin, discovered 90 years ago. Since then, many antibiotics found. Since discovery use antibiotics, bacteria evolved resist antibiotics multiply even antibiotics present. These called ""antibiotic-resistant bacteria."" Antibiotic resistance evolves mutations (genetic changes) bacterial DNA allow bacteria survive presence antibiotics. A year ago, World Health Organization published report 12 different bacterial strains resistant antibiotics. For antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains, solutions antibiotics must found kill bacteria. My research group believes that, prevent biofilm formation, able successfully fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
"You guessed it–science! Fluorescent colors special. You might seen fluorescence ever seen blacklight poster paint illuminated blacklight. Fluorescent colors seem glow, absorb one color light emit different color. This way pigment (color) molecules release energy light absorb. When pigment molecule absorbs light energy, usually slowly releases energy heat. Instead, fluorescent molecule releases energy light absorbed new light lower energy light absorbed. Normal pigments cannot this—they bounce back colors light exist already environment. That fluorescent colors look amazing bit unbelievable. Remember everything looks blue 60 feet sea? Like living blacklight posters, fluorescent fish absorb blue light, emit red light. Fish live deeper, bluer water even brighter red fluorescence."
"Shakespeare innovator language. People quote plays time without realizing it. If ever heard someone say ""love blind"" ""all glitters gold,"" they're quoting The Merchant Venice. In fact, Shakespeare credited inventing 1700 words phrases. Do know joint bends middle arm? Without Shakespeare, word elbow! Not Shakespeare shaped English language he's also hand almost every form popular culture. From books music modern theatre, Shakespeare served inspiration. The popular TV series Breaking Bad part inspired Macbeth — House Cards takes cues Richard III, show Empire compared King Lear. One reason work endured wrote universal themes. His storylines dramatic engaging. His dialogue witty poetic. He wrote tales forbidden romance, political intrigue, murder revenge. In time, plays comparable modern blockbusters."
"Tornadoes usually form large thunderstorms. When winds beneath storm unstable, blow different speeds. These unstable winds underneath thunderstorm begin rotate. If rotating air gets pushed storm, gain strength speed. A dark cone air may swirl storm. This called funnel cloud. If funnel touches ground, becomes tornado. Tornadoes form quickly. They create strongest winds planet, speeds top 200 miles per hour. In 1967, powerful tornado struck Oak Lawn, Illinois. Patti Ernst lived tornado child. ""Our garage blew away. Our car crunched,"" remembered interview Chicago television station, WGN. Still, knew could much worse. A powerful twister rip houses concrete foundations flatten whole neighborhoods. ""My family lucky,"" Ernst said. The Oak Lawn tornado destroyed 100 homes, killed dozens people. But survivors 2011's Joplin, Missouri tornado know tornadoes much worse.

"There two ways scientists talk amnesia. First, amnesia happen alongside problems. For example, diseases injuries cause damage hippocampus cause memory loss. These include Alzheimer's disease traumatic brain injury. Both conditions cause memory loss, usually also cause problems person's ability think. For example, person Alzheimer's disease traumatic brain injury might difficulty planning day making good decisions. So, people Alzheimer's disease traumatic brain injury memory loss, say amnesia one symptoms. People different degrees amnesia symptom, mild memory problems severe memory problems. Having amnesia part large set problems fairly common. But amnesia also occur itself, without problems."
"Heart disease major cause health problems worldwide. There many different types heart disease, one fairly common lots negative side effects called cardiomyopathy. We know humans many mammals, including dogs, get cardiomyopathy. In dilated cardiomyopathy heart changes shape often electrical signals within heart change. Because changes, heart able pump blood around body well, means oxygen nutrients delivered body optimal levels. This affect day-to-day life, also cause early death.

"A typical photograph motionless picture viewed single perspective. In real world, however, view scene move around look things different angles. Leika dog sitting chair. We sometimes see chair see Leika, depending particular vantage point. How much view Leika blocked chair depends standing. It also important note get sense depth pictures. In photos, tell chair (usually) closer us Leika, partially blocks view her. Knowing close far away things partly depends upon binocular vision. Binocular vision means left right eyes see things slightly different viewpoints, located different sides face. This means brain merge together information two perspectives. This process called stereopsis."
"There many situations think something talk somebody movement body time. For example, might talk homework friend walking school. Or might ride bike listening music. At first sight, situations seem tricky, probably done things many times life. But happens need cross busy street way school? Maybe stop talking focus attention traffic, reach side street safely. Researchers interested relationship thinking moving often ask people perform tasks thinking moving components laboratory. The researchers want find whether people's performances movement task thinking task get worse need two things time."
"To interpret context social settings, brain relies network brain regions, including frontal, temporal, insular regions. These regions help update contextual information focus something (say, traffic light walking street). That information helps anticipate might happen next, based previous experiences. If change seeing (as keep walking street, mean-looking Doberman appears), frontal regions activate update predictions (""this may dangerous!""). These predictions influenced context (""oh, dog leash"") previous experience (""yeah, I attacked dog bad!""). If person's frontal regions damaged, find difficult recognize influence context. Thus, Doberman may perceived threat, even person attacked dogs before! The main role frontal regions predict meaning actions analyzing contextual events surround actions."

River Dome responded, ""My grandchildren, cross over, remember fulfil promises."" After children crossed river safely, went forest. They soon filled sacks kola nuts. On way home got river again."
"The way ticks develop interact environment complicated, important understand ticks develop search hosts. Any information ticks live basis understanding epidemiology tick-borne diseases, meaning diseases spread control them. Since ticks blood feeders, must ingest large amounts blood completely develop. An adult female I. solitarius may ingest much 5–10 times weight blood one feeding. After female feeds host mates, drops ground finds shelter leaves natural material lay thousands eggs. Temperature controls egg development. The higher temperature, faster eggs develop. There optimal temperature varies among tick species, 20°C good average temperature egg development. Temperatures higher 20°C increase chance eggs die. The immature tick hatches egg called larva. The larvae must find host."
"Nowadays, many us think corn grains food chickens, pigs, farm animals, corn many uses. In food industry, corn starch, derived ground corn kernels, added various foods pasta, candies, sauces, breads, soups, stews, baby food. Some edible oils syrups also made corn, fructose sweeteners, used sodas even juices sold supermarkets. Processed corn also used medicines, cosmetics, glues, paper, textiles, paints, solvents. Corn residues ""scraps"" recently used create biodegradable materials similar plastics. Another use corn use sugars make biodiesel fuel use cars vehicles. So, eat corn additive mixed different foods, side dish like delicious corn cob, grits, snack form nachos popcorn: around world, many dishes—and cultures—that totally revolve around corn. In cultures, corn central component cuisines."
"Whales marine mammals dive obtain food underwater often dive bouts. The bouts periods whale dives repeatedly, short amount time surface next dive. We think marine mammals dive bouts get much food possible diving. For example, find large school fish, want spend much time surface school escapes, dive quickly get catch fish. Therefore, stay surface long enough replenish oxygen. However, time surface may long enough remove nitrogen blood. Because this, amount nitrogen increases slowly dive dive, sometimes increases enough bubbles may form whales return surface."
"When thinking yawn, people mostly pay attention respiratory, breathing, aspect. When breathing, inhale increase oxygen supply, exhale get rid excess carbon dioxide. So, deep breath accompanies yawning led many people believe purpose yawns increase oxygen levels. While explanation seems make good sense, research conducted 30 years ago firmly rejected idea. In clear test whether yawning caused low oxygen levels, Dr. Robert Provine et al. designed experiment changed content air inhaled participants laboratory witnessed effects air yawning. The researchers separate conditions participants either inhaled air extra oxygen extra carbon dioxide. These experiments demonstrated neither breathing pure oxygen increased levels carbon dioxide altered rate yawning humans. In words, results study revealed yawning unaffected amount oxygen air, yawning, breathing controlled separate mechanisms."

"Studies shown people grateful others automatically think things happen positive way. Most situations happen lives 100% good 100% bad. How think interpret happens us plays big role feel situation. Most people learned ""thinking habits"" repeat again. One thinking habits called ""positive interpretation bias,"" means likely interpret neutral negative situation positive way. For example, falling bike, could think ""I got lucky I get hurt"" feel grateful. Or, could think ""I can't believe I stupid fall bike"" feel really angry. Having grateful thoughts would example positive interpretation bias."

"A concussion injury brain caused sudden, abrupt movement head, typically blow jolt head body makes brain move rapidly inside skull. The injury results called mild traumatic brain injury, commonly referred concussion. There many different definitions concussion, things common. These common features include changes brain function, including changes way think (cognitive changes), way brain works (neurological changes), way feel (physical emotional changes). These changes may may accompanied temporary loss consciousness, also known fainting passing out. The abrupt movement brain stretch injure brain cells, change way cells function. These changes short-lived long-lived, time, cells heal function normally 7–10 days. Sometimes, may take longer 10 days brain return normal concussion, especially children."
"It hard figure little kids learn something complicated language. Do copy parents? Do start making sounds right words come out? Do find patterns learn sounds go together lot, like b-a-b-y? Do learn different words match different things use figure words mean? Do make guesses words come next learn mistakes? Do want fun moms, dads, brothers, sisters, motivates learn language? Different scientists think learning happens different ways. There many possibilities. While scientists love disagree other, generally agree learning builds time. The first years life matter lot ability learn later ability well school. What's exciting language learning still big mystery, scientists plenty work coming decades (or even centuries)!"

"A situation ""game"" whenever (i) one person making decision (ii) people's decisions impact one another. Just everything life game game-theory sense. At home, school, everywhere go, everything do, playing games. Do believe me? Think back beginning day, woke up. How quickly got bed impacted parents—and early woke impacted you—so game! Think happened next, throughout rest day. From bathroom breakfast table, classroom playground, make choices impact others well yourself. You're playing games! Knowing game theory help improve experience situations—not ""win,"" improve relationships happier life. Game theory used study people likely behave strategic situations, applications economics, political science, business strategy, law, entrepreneurship, military science, name few."
"The similarities differences microbiomes different animals made us wonder species similar diets similar microbiomes, whether microbiomes similar species related. For example, dolphin penguin similar microbiome eat fish? Or, even though similar diets, dolphins penguins different microbiomes closely related species? In science, common create hypothesis, design experiment, series experiments, test it. The results experiments reported trustworthy scientific journal. Other scientists read report journal come new ideas. Our hypothesis would see bacteria birds animals diet. Because hypothesis needed multiple experiments compare microbiomes different birds, would impossible single experiment. To overcome problem, performed something called meta-study. A meta-study involves looking lots different studies topic comparing results studies."
"A delegate someone either chosen elected vote act others. In organizations like United Nations, country sends delegates represent them. Before general election US, process select candidates begins delegates. At state level major political parties selects delegates attend national convention. The two ways delegates selected caucus Primary election. Each state may different ways select delegates political parties. The Republican Party lets state decide select delegates. The Democratic Party uses proportional method awarding delegates. The percentage delegates candidate awarded depends caucus many elected candidate. Candidate ""X"" may 40 percent, candidate ""Y"" may 20 percent candidate ""Z"" may 50 percent. Any remaining percent may undecided votes candidates."
"Antibiotics used almost century treat bacterial diseases humans also animals. Throughout time, bacteria looking strategies survive antibiotic treatment. Imagine battlefield, population bacteria attacked small bullets (antibiotics). If one bacteria find shield protect itself, survive. The surviving bacteria advantage resistant antibiotics forever descendants. This reason why, get sick, take pills prescribed doctor, even already feel better. This important prevent ""survivors"" battle! Bacteria resistant antibiotics (called ""superbugs"") dangerous us, weapons fight them. Also, resistant bacteria transmitted people even animals. Nowadays, high number bacteria become resistant many different antibiotics, threat people worldwide."
"Optogenetics method controlling neuron's activity using light genetic engineering. Genetic engineering process scientists change information genetic code (the blueprints) living thing. In optogenetic studies, scientists take genetic code neurons want study add new piece code it. The new code allows neurons make special proteins, called opsins, respond light. Opsins occur naturally first discovered algae, use proteins help move toward light. But opsin get neuron? This requires specialized laboratory techniques. Let's look mouse example. To get opsin neurons mouse, genetic code opsin must carefully inserted genetic code neurons mouse. If done correctly, every neuron mouse opsin. Because understand lot genetic code mouse, choose put opsin. We insert code specific type neuron, specific location brain."
"Why humans feel need creative enjoy creative material? While creativity basic part human thinking, counts creativity measure it? Creativity often viewed subjective field, meaning everyone's personal opinion creativity different, need really clear definition order understand creativity is. So, exactly creativity? While many components creativity, including originality, pleasure, value, process, imagination, definition scientists use study creativity puts components together say creativity ability produce something novel (or original) utility (is valuable someone). This definition allows scientists develop testable hypotheses creativity arises human brain. We interact with, process, produce creativity differently, makes creating universal definition creativity challenging. As Steve Jobs reminds us, even creative people hard time seeing things think create creative!"

No solar eclipse last longer 7 minutes 58 seconds speed Earth Moon move. When Sun involved, event called occultation."
"Back time, humans animal Earth needed eat. Food consisted fruits cereals, rich carbohydrates. Carbohydrates main nutrients still today. As name says, formed basically Carbon atoms bounded Hydrogen also Oxygen atoms. Glucose one simplest carbohydrates, known 6 atoms Carbon, 12 Hydrogen, 6 Oxygen. Many carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, lactose, etc.) sweet, reason also known sugars. The second important nutrient early humans probably protein, hunting/fishing wild animals best way get protein. Lipids, vitamins minerals, nutrients needed keep early humans alive obtained vegetable/fruit animal foods. But one thing missing—actually important one—water. A relevant point article way Homo drank water fire discovery. Before fire discovered, humans obviously drink water ""room"" temperature, discovered fire, humans able prepare hot drinks. The ability heat water probably made eating enjoyable early humans."
"Electronic engineering discipline investigates kinds situations related electricity magnetism. Electronic engineers concerned processes as; transfer information using radio waves, design electronic circuits, design computer systems, development control systems aircraft autopilots embedded systems. The term electronic engineering started emerge late 1950s. Before second world war, electronic engineering commonly known 'radio engineering'. At time, studying radio engineering university part physics degree. Later, consumer devices started developed, field broadened include modern TV, audio systems, Hi-Fi later computers microprocessors. In mid late 1950s, term radio engineering gradually gave way name 'electronic engineering', became standalone university degree subject. Fundamental studies discipline sciences physics mathematics help get qualitative quantitative descriptions systems work."

"Clouds, whether big gray layers, fluffy white lumps, streaks sky aeroplanes, things common. Most importantly, made tiny droplets water, called ""cloud droplets."" Cloud droplets form hot air Earth's surface rises slowly cools down. Like particles, cloud droplets small fall ground (unless cloud raining). The rising air around pushing up, gravity pulling down, end floating around sky. In sky, unless kind surface stick to, unless really, really cold (-38°C), water exists gas. When surface, water liquefy (become liquid) freeze onto surface, ground. However, sky, big obvious surfaces. Therefore, make cloud droplet, need tiny particle, small surface water stick to. The particle acts seed droplet."

These plant relationships easy overlook hard study. Still, important affect healthy plants are. Soil full millions microscopic bacteria fungi. These microscopic organisms collectively called microbes. Some microbes form close partnerships plants. Plants rely microbes help get nutrients scarce soil. Microbes break dead plants animals, process slowly releases nitrogen, phosphorus, elements plants need grow. When plants cannot get enough nutrients own, send sugars roots. The energy microbes get sugars helps break even dead plants animals. If enough nutrients available soil, though, plants would rather keep sugars themselves."

"Microbial communities characterized using certain tests look DNA molecules microbes. DNA, might already know, genetic material cell. It contains instructions, form genes, provide blueprint creating organism. Studying specific genes good way scientists learn microbial communities. For example, look gene called 16S rRNA gene. The 16S rRNA gene tells us relationships microbes, called ""phylogenetic"" marker gene. ""Phylogenetic"" derived Greek words meaning origin tribe family. There marker genes used study, too, including genes coding special proteins called enzymes—specifically enzymes important using sulfur energy. By studying DNA microbes using several different methods, described below, able study three things: many microbes present samples taken groundwater, microbes grew time microcosm, microbes related microbes know about."
"Like part body, spinal cord injured. Some people damage spinal cords dive swimming pool shallow diving, even traffic accident. When spinal cord damaged, messages brain cannot travel rest body. Therefore, spinal cord injury, brain may longer able send messages legs affected person may lose ability walk. A higher injury, spinal cord damaged closer neck (in cervical level), may cause even severe problems people left unable move arms. Worst all, cells spinal cord sensitive, damage often permanent, meaning cannot fixed. In United States America, estimated 906 people living spinal cord injury every million people country. More half spinal cord injuries cervical level, people get injuries aged 15 30 happens."
"The hyena monkey argument. They went judge settle differences. After judge listened case, afraid pass judgement case. He thought himself, ""If I condemn hyena, eat cattle. And I condemn monkey, eat corn! So, I do?"" The judge thought while, said, ""The case difficult judge alone. You go elders village."" So, hyena monkey went elders. They told elders disagreement. After elders listened case, also afraid pass judgement. If supported monkey, hyena might eat cattle. If supported hyena, monkey might eat corn. The elders told Hyena Monkey case difficult. Suddenly, elders remembered poor woman town. She nothing lose, neither cattle corn. ""She pass judgement without fear,"" said elders one another. They told two animals go her."
"To understand mechanism behind reading emotions, let us think human face. Have ever heard saying ""The eyes windows soul""? Maybe bit unlikely see someone's soul eyes (our eyes real windows all), one reasons people use saying eyes important understanding people feeling. In fact, learn lot others facial expressions, people tell lot us faces. Think ways express emotions using face! Even babies seem born understanding importance faces, early 9 minutes birth, babies prefer look faces rather objects. By time 12 days old, babies already imitate facial gestures adults. This ability important development helps later learn speak think."
"Tuberculosis (TB) important public health problem. It estimated 2014, 9.6 million people developed TB, almost 2 million people died disease, India, Indonesia, China presented almost half cases occurring world. TB caused bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis spread person person air, someone disease coughs, talks, sneezes. It estimated one third people infected bacteria get sick still bacteria hiding bodies, doctors call ""latent"" (or dormant) state. There one vaccine currently approved TB humans, called Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG). This vaccine given 3 billion people since developed 1921, around 115 million doses per year given newborns. The BCG vaccine made living bacteria weakened lab unable cause disease. This type vaccine, using weak still living bacteria, called live attenuated vaccine."
"Sea level changed naturally past, mostly due growth melting large ice sheets ice ages. During peak last ice age (~20,000 years ago), sea level ~120 lower today. Because global warming occurred 20,000 10,000 years ago (which natural influenced humans), rate sea level rise 1.2 cm per year 10,000 years, leveled zero. During span time, several episodes extra rapid sea level rise happened. For example, 14,000 years ago, rate sea level rise jumped 3 cm per year, ice sheet melting. The last time climate earth similar today's climate 120,000 years ago, ice age episodes. Sea level least 6 higher today, almost certainly parts Greenland West Antarctic ice sheets smaller now."
"Face pareidolia (par-i-DOH-lee-a) see faces objects actually real faces. How see object come life face? When brain gets message eyes information seeing, message sent occipital lobe, part way back brain deals vision. When message arrives occipital lobe, yet organized face. Instead, message made information patterns light dark well edges. A process begins kind like assembly line builds face, parts face put together travels occipital lobe. As assembly line finishes traveling occipital lobe, carries parts face built different brain area, temporal lobes, located behind ears. In temporal lobes, information put together complete picture, process building face finished."

Eric Mark experts finding young stars, two signs young star (i) lots star spots look like black dots surface cooler regions star (ii) spin faster older stars. Our Sun takes 25 days spin around once, young stars take 2–3 days spin around. As young stars spin around, star spots surface come view, changes light levels small amount. By looking light given young stars, Eric Mark see brightness change small repeatable amount every time star spins around, SuperWASP database ideal place look evidence new stars. One stars looked called J1407, saw light data star looked strange."
"Neurons come many forms, shapes sizes, helpful think neuron like tree. A neuron three main parts, cell body, axon, dendrites. The tree trunk (cell body) stores genetic information (DNA) compartment called nucleus. The cell body also contains chemical machinery produce neurotransmitters neuron uses communicate other. The tree's branches (dendrite, word déndron comes Greek language actually means ""tree"") parts neuron receive signals. Dendrites thought like antennae, receiving signals neurons, but, I explain, this. The tree root (axon) structure used neuron connect talk another neuron. An axon carries information similar cable carries electricity. When one neuron wants share message another, sends electrical impulse, called action potential, axon reaches axon terminal, end axon."
"As Johnson worked math problems female computers, would ask questions. She want work — wanted know ""hows"" ""whys,"" ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began stand out. Women allowed attend meetings male engineers scientists. Johnson wanted go meetings learn projects, went. She became known training geometry began work teams made men. Eventually, recognized leader, men increasingly relied answers needed. In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part space team. She began calculating flight path, trajectory path, rocket put first American space 1961. That American astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew wanted Shepard's space capsule land, tricky part calculate rocket would launch. Johnson figured out!"
"Although 13th, 14th, 15th amendments outlawed slavery, provided equal protection law, guaranteed citizenship, protected right vote, individual states continued allow unfair treatment minorities passed Jim Crow laws allowing segregation public facilities. These upheld Supreme Court Plessy v. Ferguson (1895), found state laws requiring racial segregation ""separate equal"" constitutional. This finding helped continue legalized discrimination well 20th century. Following World War II, pressures recognize, challenge, change inequalities minorities grew. One notable challenges status quo 1954 landmark Supreme Court case Brown v. Board Education Topeka, Kansas questioned notion ""separate equal"" public education. The Court found ""separate educational facilities inherently unequal"" violation 14th Amendment. This decision polarized Americans, fostered debate, served catalyst encourage federal action protect civil rights. Each year, 1945 1957, Congress considered failed pass civil rights bill. Congress finally passed limited Civil Rights Acts 1957 1960, offered moderate gains."
"Non-alphabetic orthographies represent either syllable (for example, Cherokee, Tamil, Japanese Kana) one-syllable unit meaning (as Chinese, Japanese Kanji) symbol. Similar alphabetic orthographies, unit spoken language represented symbol, non-alphabetic orthographies, unlike alphabetic ones, unit spoken language larger phoneme. Chinese often referred pictograph (a language made pictures), people think characters pictures words represent. In fact, Chinese characters actually pictures words represent. Rather, Chinese, symbols represent unit pronunciation (a syllable) also unit meaning (a morpheme), thus Chinese considered morpho-syllabic writing system. Approximately 80–90% Chinese characters also contain called phonetic radical. A phonetic radical one part character provides clue say word."
"Your skin cells keep dividing, die give birth new cells time, even injured. After injury, skin makes bunch new cells uses heal wound. Yet, nerve cells brain, also called neurons, renew themselves. They divide all. There exceptions rule – two special places brain give birth new neurons. For part though, brain cannot replenish dead neurons. This especially worrisome neurons sensitive cells die sorts reasons. When bump head suffer concussion, neurons die. When glitch blood supply brain, also called stroke, neurons die. Neurons also die faced changes functions, happens so-called neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease. Here good news. Because loss neurons usually permanent, scientists working two important strategies help brain injury. One way protect nervous system immediately damage occurs."

"The development antibiotics one biggest successes modern medicine. Antibiotics saved millions lives since doctors started using 1940s. Antibiotics helped humans much better lives successfully treating almost types bacterial infections. But like us, bacteria smart, too! Since 1940s, bacteria developing tactics overcome effects antibiotics, today seeing bacteria longer killed antibiotics all. These become known antibiotic-resistant bacteria ""superbugs,"" serious threat health people world. If antibiotics stop bacterial infections, even something simple small infected cut finger could become life-threatening. Therefore, new weapons, form new antibiotics, needed treat infections caused antibiotic-resistant bacteria."
"Our immune systems work protect us illness recognizing foreign molecules, like bacteria viruses, reacting molecules. Bacteria viruses cause infection known pathogens. When cells infected pathogen, pathogen start reproduce making copies DNA RNA (cellular instructions) also produce lot molecules fight defense mechanisms immune system. The pathogen's DNA molecules produces foreign human cells and, therefore, act ""danger"" signal indicating something wrong infected cell. This danger signal causes phosphatidylserine exposed surface infected cell attract macrophages. After macrophages arrive infected cell phagocytose it, present pieces pathogen, known antigens, immune cells, immune system create memory specific pathogen. If infected cells phagocytosed macrophages, cells, even whole organ, become infected pathogen."
"Physical water scarcity often caused drought. A drought occurs rains far less given area usually does, creating shortages water supply. Droughts declared little 15 days without rainfall continue indefinitely. The longest drought recorded history lasted 400 years Atacama Desert Chile. However, modern droughts nearly severe. In United States, National Drought Mitigation Center finds panhandle Oklahoma northern Georgia experiencing ‘extreme drought'. California experienced severe drought 2012 2017, Florida experienced severe drought 2006-2007, 2017. Droughts considered severe water shortages become common extreme major crop loss occurs.

Then, laundry load, starch used again."
"Memory large topic, researchers divide topic memory make easier study. There long-term memory, short-term memory, working memory. Long-term memory allows remember information time—for minutes, whole life. For example, divided groups given number, remember group number entire activity. Or, remember name lifetime. Short-term memory stores immediate information erased less minute. For example, someone tells phone number dial immediately forget it. It difficult dial phone number person tells whole phone number once, opposed telling number bits pieces. When work short-term memory, called working memory. For example, read sentence, need remember first words sentence finish reading end sentence. Or else, sentence make sense! Some researchers divide short-term memory verbal memory visuospatial memory ."
"Social exclusion refers experience socially isolated, either physically (for example, totally alone), emotionally (for example, ignored told one unwanted). When someone excludes you, probably feel bad even experience ""painful"" feelings. Why social exclusion cause feelings? One possibility human beings social animals, selected evolution live together others. Social exclusion tells us social relationships threatened damaged, therefore, exclusion tells us crisis, causing aversive feelings. Previous research psychologists (people study mind behavior) social neuroscientists (people study neural, hormonal, cellular, gametic mechanisms underlying social interaction behavior) revealed much happens social exclusion. Before beginning explain social exclusion dynamically affects mind, brain, behavior, I would like briefly introduce mystery social pain—defined painful feeling caused social exclusion."
"We learned results people afraid spiders imagine bigger. We also learned order overestimate size object, object needs cause person feel fear unpleasantness daily basis. We demonstrated work negative emotions (fear unpleasantness) cause people overestimate size. But positive emotions? Some studies found positive emotions could also change size estimation. For example, expert golf players estimate physical size hole ball hit larger non-expert players estimate hole be. The next question asked causes what? Do people image big spider mind afraid spiders? Or afraid spiders see one, see bigger really is? This question requires studies. Such additional studies important understanding people afraid spiders help scientists develop ways help people get fear."
"One simple example would setting experiment see particular plant food improved plant growth month. First, would get 20 type plants similar age size. In example, plant type, age, size start experiment variables want keep same. Next, would divide plants two groups numbering randomly drawing numbers. The first 10 plants would go treatment group—the plants get plant food. The second 10 plants go call control group—these plants get plant food. This method assigning things groups called randomization, makes sure every plant involved study equal chance picked either group. This best way make sure groups equal possible. Then, month, give plant food treatment group control group. All variables kept exactly same—the plants get amount sunlight, environment, water."

"Probably widely accepted theory explaining evolution larval stages need dispersal. Sessile organisms barnacles tunicates, sea-floor groups like mussels crabs, need way move young new territory, since cannot move long distances adults. Many species relatively long pelagic larval stages (how long larva water column). During time, larvae feed grow, many species move several stages development. For example, barnacles molt six nauplius larva stages molting cipris, look settle. The larvae eat different food adults, disperse. The consideration small size eggs. If animals lay many small eggs (and do), young stages cannot live life adults lead. They must live separate life size capability live adult. This larvae do."

"A discrete cosine transform math process used make things like MP3s, JPEGs smaller. It breaking sound picture different frequencies. One way calculate discrete cosine transform use Fourier transformation. ""Discrete"" means works discrete-time signals (sampled data). For sounds, frequencies simple tones. You make sound playing several tones time. The discrete cosine transform way find tones play order make given sound. The difference tones pitch. Human ears good hearing low pitches, bad hearing high pitches. If use DCT break sound tones, need careful playing higher tones people cannot hear well.

The sun's rays concentrated reflector, moves rate sun heats vertical boiler, setting motive steam-engine work. As may supposed, object demonstrate possibility utilizing concentrated heat solar rays; I closely examined it, apparatus seems capable great utility existing circumstances. Here France, indeed, radical drawback--the sun often overclouded. Thousands years ago idea utilizing solar rays must suggested itself, still savage tribes know mode combustion; scientific application hitherto lacking. This void apparatus fill up."
"The tree dioecious, bearing male catkins one plant, female another. All female trees Europe believed originated tree near Geneva, Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured grafts, distributed throughout Continent. Nevertheless, female tree rarely met with, compared male; quite possible tree generally produces male flowers may sometimes bear female flowers only. We certain evidence case Gingkgo, common enough occurrence dioecious plants, occurrence fruiting specimen near Philadelphia, recently recorded Mr. Meehan, may possibly attributed cause. The tree give figure growing Broadlands, Hants, 40 feet height, trunk measures 7 feet girth 3 feet ground, spread branches measuring 45 feet. These dimensions considerably exceeded cases. In 1837 tree Purser's Cross measured 60 feet height."
"The interesting change Census gives account increase number farms. The number virtually doubled within twenty years. The population country increased like proportion. A large part increase number farms due division great estates. Nor occurred, may imagine, exclusively Southern States States immigration migration recently directed. It important fact multiplication farms continued even older Northern States, though change great States far West South. In New York increase 25,000, 11.5 percent, number farms since 1870; New Jersey increase 12.2 percent, Pennsylvania 22.7 percent, though increase population, doubtless number persons engaged farming, much smaller."
"It stands reason summers warmer able grow grapes successfully open walls; therefore probable new grape bag, invention M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque, Paris, intended serve double purpose, viz., protecting fruit hastening maturity, will, becomes known, welcomed country. It consists square curved glass fixed bag sun's rays concentrated upon fruit, thereby rendering ripening certain addition improving quality generally. The glass affixed bag means light iron wire support. It covers portion next sun, increases amount light warms grapes without scorching them, result due convexity glass layer air bag. M. Pelletier idea rendering bags cheaper employing plain squares instead curved ones, advantage thus obtained counterbalanced comparative inefficacy."

"L. Clemandot devised new method treating metals, especially steel, consists heating cherry red, compressing strongly keeping pressure metal completely cooled. The results much like tempering calls process tempering compression. The compressed metal becomes exceedingly hard, acquiring molecular contraction fineness grain polishing gives appearance polished nickel. Compressed steel, like tempered steel, acquires coercitive force enables absorb magnetism. This property studied connection durability; experiments already shown loss magnetism expiration three months. This compression analogue tempering. Hammering hardening modify molecular state metals, especially practiced upon metal nearly cold, effect hydraulic pressure much greater. The phenomena produced methods tempering may interpreted different ways, seems likely molecular approximation, amorphism results homogeneity due absence crystallization."
"From among cloud proposals, experiments, inventions, two great systems length disentangled themselves. They English construction built-up wrought iron coils, Prussian construction solid steel castings. Wrought-iron, aware, nearly pure iron, containing trace carbon. Steel, used guns, contains 0.3 0.5 per cent carbon; larger quantity carbon, harder steel. Since early days I speaking, great improvement taken place qualities materials, especially steel. Still general characteristics noted, may broadly stated, England chose confessedly weaker material, control, cheaper, safer intrust lives men; Prussia selected stronger less manageable substance, hope improving uniformity, rendering thoroughly trustworthy. The difference strength, sound, great. Roughly, gun steel twice strong wrought iron."
"Differences obtained estimation nitrogen substances frequently source much annoyance. The cause discrepancies chiefly due lack uniformity material, sufficiently fine state combustion. The hair found commerce manufacture fertilizers, generally mixed sand dust. Wool dust often contains old buttons, pieces wood, shoe pegs, sorts things. The flesh fertilizers composed light particles flesh mixed heavier bone dust. Even taking possible precautions finely comminute substances mechanical means, still imperfect results obtained, impurities, say, sand, never intimately mixed lighter particles sample 0.5 0.8 gramme, used determination nitrogen, correspond correct average contents. In substances dried blood, pulverization tedious."

This battery first employed purpose utilizing waste solution bichromate batteries, great quantity thrown away completely exhausted. This waste unavoidable, consequence impossibility permitting batteries, employed telegraphic purposes, run complete exhaustion reduction solutions effected; therefore valuable chemicals sacrificed insure constancy working. The fragments zinc cell also remains amalgamated zinc plates bichromate batteries, mercury employed securing good metallic connection soon augmented remaining dissolution zinc. It therefore seen solution, also zinc mercury remnants bichromate batteries utilized, time considerable quantity electricity generated."
"He feels, ‘I possession truth'—how many possessions renounce order save feeling! What would throw overboard order stay ‘on top'—that is, others lack ‘the truth'! The state hurt others certainly seldom agreeable, unadulterated way, benefit others; sign still lacking power, betrays frustration face poverty; brings new dangers uncertainties power possess clouds horizon prospect revenge, scorn, punishment, failure. Only irritable covetous adherents feeling power—to sight already subjected (the objects benevolence) burden boredom—might pleasurable imprint seal power reluctant. It depends one accustomed spice one's life; matter taste whether one prefers slow sudden, safe dangerous daring increase power—one always spice according one's temperament."
"The nature incrustation evils resulting therefrom stated, remains consider methods devised overcome them. These methods naturally resolve two kinds, chemical mechanical. The chemical method two modifications; one design purify water large tanks reservoirs, addition certain substances shall precipitate scale-forming ingredients water fed boiler; chemical agent fed boiler time time, object effect precipitation saline matter manner form solid masses adherent scale. Where chemical methods purification resorted to, latter plan generally followed least troublesome. Of many substances used purpose, however, measurably successful; majority unsatisfactory objectionable."

Some people created temperatures close absolute zero: record temperature 100 pK (one hundred picokelvin, equal 10-10 kelvin) absolute zero. Even getting close absolute zero difficult anything touches object cooled near absolute zero would give heat objects."
"An abyssal plain underwater plain deep ocean floor, usually found depths 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) 6,000 metres (20,000 ft). Lying generally foot continental rise mid-ocean ridge, abyssal plains cover 50% Earth's surface. They among flattest, smoothest least explored regions Earth. Abyssal plains key geologic elements oceanic basins (the elements elevated mid-ocean ridge flanking abyssal hills). In addition elements, active oceanic basins (those associated moving plate tectonic boundary) also typically include oceanic trench subduction zone. Abyssal plains recognized distinct physiographic features sea floor late 1940s and, recently, none studied systematic basis. They poorly preserved sedimentary record, tend consumed subduction process. The creation abyssal plain end result spreading seafloor (plate tectonics) melting lower oceanic crust."

"An acid substance donate hydrogen ion (H+) (generally speaking, proton) another substance. Acids pH less 7.0. A chemical donate proton hydrogen atom attached electronegative atom like oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine. Some acids strong others weak. The weak acids hold protons, strong acids let go them. All acids release hydrogen ions solutions. The amount ions get released per molecule determine acid weak strong. Weak acids acids partially release hydrogen atoms attached. These acids, then, may lower pH dissociation hydrogen ions, completely. Weak acids generally pH value 4-6 strong acids pH value 1 3. A base acid's ""chemical opposite."" A base substance accept acid's hydrogen atom. Bases molecules split apart water release hydroxide ions. Acids bases typically exist together equilibrium."
"Active noise control (ANC), also known noise cancellation, active noise reduction (ANR), method reducing unwanted sound addition second sound specifically designed cancel first. Sound pressure wave, consists alternating periods compression rarefaction. A noise-cancellation speaker emits sound wave amplitude inverted phase (also known antiphase) original sound. The waves combine form new wave, process called interference, effectively cancel - effect called destructive interference. Modern active noise control generally achieved use analog circuits digital signal processing. Adaptive algorithms designed analyze waveform background aural nonaural noise, based specific algorithm generate signal either phase shift invert polarity original signal. This inverted signal (in antiphase) amplified transducer creates sound wave directly proportional amplitude original waveform, creating destructive interference. This effectively reduces volume perceivable noise."
"Aerodynamics, Greek (dynamics), branch fluid dynamics concerned studying motion air, particularly interacts solid object, airplane wing. Aerodynamics sub-field fluid dynamics gas dynamics, many aspects aerodynamics theory common fields. The term aerodynamics often used synonymously gas dynamics, difference ""gas dynamics"" applies study motion gases, limited air. Formal aerodynamics study modern sense began eighteenth century, although observations fundamental concepts aerodynamic drag recorded much earlier. Most early efforts aerodynamics worked towards achieving heavier-than-air flight, first demonstrated Wilbur Orville Wright 1903. Since then, use aerodynamics mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, computer simulations formed scientific basis ongoing developments heavier-than-air flight number technologies."
"As ran Fred's shop, Walugo remembered crunchy fried tail fins. And eyes, sweet tasty! Eventually, Walugo chose three fishes. Fred added fourth fish, tiny. On way home, Walugo stopped eat tiny fish. He ate slowly, including soft bones. It delicious. He began think three fishes bag. Three fishes crunchy fins tails. When Walugo finally arrived home, angry mother asked, ""Where time?"" She opened bag looked inside. ""What happened here?"" asked. The fishes fins, tails, heads! Walugo wished greedy. He finally said, ""I know happened."" His mother looked him, say anything. That night, Walugo family sat eat. His mother served person, except Walugo. They began enjoy fried fish ugali. Walugo asked, ""Where's food?"" ""I know food is,"" answered mother. ""Perhaps food fins, tails heads disappeared,"" said Walugo's father."
"Many Founding Fathers United States believed Enlightenment's ideas. For example, idea government's job benefit country's people people power important them. They made idea government ""for people"" one important parts new United States Constitution new American government created. The Enlightenment's ideas also important people fought French Revolution 1789. In countries, kings queens took Enlightenment's ideas made changes governments. However, still kept power themselves. These kings queens called ""enlightened despots."" Examples include Catherine Great Russia, Frederick Great Prussia, Gustav III Sweden. During Age Enlightenment, people began use reason, began disagree idea God created world. This caused conflicts - and, later, war."
"John Locke, one influential Enlightenment thinkers, based governance philosophy social contract theory, subject permeated Enlightenment political thought. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes ushered new debate work Leviathan 1651. Hobbes also developed fundamentals European liberal thought: right individual; natural equality men; artificial character political order (which led later distinction civil society state); view legitimate political power must ""representative"" based consent people; liberal interpretation law leaves people free whatever law explicitly forbid. Both Locke Rousseau developed social contract theories Two Treatises Government Discourse Inequality, respectively. While quite different works, Locke, Hobbes Rousseau agreed social contract, government's authority lies consent governed, necessary people live civil society."
"The agora (agorá) central public space ancient Greek city-states. It best representation city form's response accommodate social political order polis.The literal meaning word ""gathering place"" ""assembly"". The agora center athletic, artistic, spiritual political life city. The Ancient Agora Athens best-known example. Early Greek history (10th–8th centuries BC), free-born citizens would gather agora military duty hear statements ruling king council. Later, agora also served marketplace, merchants kept stalls shops sell goods amid colonnades. This attracted artisans built workshops nearby. From twin functions agora political commercial space came two Greek verbs, agorázo, ""I shop"", and, agoreúo, ""I speak public"". The term agoraphobia denotes phobic condition sufferer becomes anxious environments unfamiliar – instance, places perceive little control."
"Executive functions thinking abilities allow us achieve goals. For example, executive functions allow stay task, plan ahead, hold onto thoughts, solve problems, refrain inappropriate actions (like talking back teacher). In patients experienced TBI 4 years ago, studied executive function called working memory T, mental workspace holds information immediate use. For example, remembering numbers teacher writes board write problem notebook. Working memory differs called long-term memory, use remember events years. For example, working memory helps us addition heads, long-term memory allows us remember first day school. Working memory three stages: encoding (putting information in), maintenance (holding information), retrieval (remembering information using it). Usually, people hold 3–5 things working memory time. Working memory requires cooperation regions front back brain. If brain cells either regions damaged, working memory could suffer."

They formed Confederate States America, also called ""the Confederacy"". They wanted Confederate States America country, separate independent United States. Jefferson Davis chosen president Confederacy. The U.S government states remained loyal called Union. The Union sometimes called ""the North"". Every state slavery illegal supported Union. Most states North. Five states slavery legal also supported Union. These called ""border states"". War began April 12, 1861 Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter held Union garrison."
"The Anaconda Plan name applied outline strategy suppressing Confederacy beginning American Civil War. Proposed General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, plan emphasized blockade Southern ports, called advance Mississippi River cut South two. Because blockade would rather passive, widely derided vociferous faction wanted vigorous prosecution war, likened coils anaconda suffocating victim. The snake image caught on, giving proposal popular name. In early days Civil War, General-in-Chief Winfield Scott's proposed strategy war South two prominent features: first, ports seceding states rigorously blockaded; second, strong column perhaps 80,000 men use Mississippi River highway thrust completely Confederacy. A spearhead consisting relatively small amphibious force, army troops transported boats supported gunboats, advance rapidly, capturing Confederate positions river sequence."

"Assyrian architecture, like Babylonia, influenced Sumero-Akkadian styles (and degree Mitanni), early developed distinctive style. Palaces sported colourful wall decorations, seal-cutting (an art learned Mittani) developed apace. Schools scribes taught Babylonian Assyrian dialects Akkadian, Sumerian Akkadian literary works often copied Assyrian flavour. The Assyrian dialect Akkadian used legal, official, religious, practical texts medicine instructions manufacturing items. During 13th 10th centuries, picture tales appeared new art form: continuous series images carved square stone steles. Somewhat reminiscent comic book, show events warfare hunting, placed order upper left lower right corner stele captions written underneath them.

At level, resulting fundamental components stars, typically assembled clusters various condensing nebulae."
"Astronomy natural science. It study everything outside atmosphere Earth. It studies celestial objects (such stars, galaxies, planets, moons, asteroids, comets nebulae) processes (such supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, cosmic microwave background radiation). This includes physics, chemistry objects processes. A related subject, physical cosmology, concerned studying Universe whole, way universe changed time. The word astronomy comes Greek words astron means star nomos means law. A person studies astronomy called astronomer. Astronomy one oldest sciences. Ancient people used positions stars navigate, find best time plant crops. Astronomy similar astrophysics. Since 20th century two main types astronomy, observational theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy uses telescopes cameras observe look stars, galaxies astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses maths computer models predict happen."
"Astrophysics study stars planets work, learn them. Astrophysicists use physics explain astronomers find see. Astrophysics also study Universe started changing time. This part astrophysics called cosmology. For long time bodies sky seemed unchanging spheres moving circle. But Earth growth decay happened, natural motion straight line. Therefore, people thought celestial region made fundamentally different kind matter found Earth. During 16th 17th century, natural philosophers Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, began maintain celestial terrestrial regions made similar kinds material subject natural laws."

"A baby boom period marked greatly increased birth rate. This demographic phenomenon usually ascribed within certain geographical bounds. People born period often called baby boomers; however, experts distinguish born demographic baby booms identify overlapping cultural generations. The causes baby booms may involve various fertility factors. One common baby boom right WWII Cold War. The U.S. birthrate exploded World War II. From 1945 1961, 65 million children born United States. At height baby boom, child born every seven seconds. Many factors contributed baby boom. First, young couples put getting married World War II Korean War could finally begin families. Also, government encouraged growth families offering generous GI benefits home purchases. Finally, popular culture celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, large families."
"But Mt. Erebus isn’t mountain. It volcano. A volcano opening Earth’s surface. Melted rock called lava flows opening. When happens, called eruption. There volcanoes world. Some old. They erupt anymore. But many volcanoes still erupt. Mt. Erebus erupts almost every day! Ross Island cold place. It near Antarctica. This means Mt. Erebus covered snow ice year long. But inside volcano hot. Steam inside volcano comes sides cracks rock. The steam makes ice melt forms caves made ice. When hot steam moves cold air, freezes pillars. They look like icicles point sky! At top volcano lake. But lake isn’t made water. It’s made lava! Sometimes, big bubble gas inside volcano shoots big chunk lava air."
"You probably know wind water shape Earth’s land. But know glaciers too? Glaciers made ice. Ice solid. But glaciers large heavy flow like river. Glaciers found high mountains. It cold there, snow doesn’t melt. Instead, snow piles gets squished together, forming ice. Over many years, ice builds forms glacier. The glacier becomes heavy slowly moves mountains. The glacier scrapes shapes mountains’ sides moves. Glaciers also found Arctic Antarctica. They press grind land move. Glaciers shaped world surprising ways. Millions years ago, glaciers covered desert South Africa. The glaciers slowly moved, scraping across desert’s rocks. Today, see flat, polished rocks know glaciers there."
"Imagine standing North Pole. What see? First all, don’t see land. In fact, aren’t standing land all, instead atop sheet ice floating cold, deep ocean. At South Pole, would land, atop high, flat plateau. So strangely, “bottom world” actually pretty high! Bundle up, even summer North Pole cold. The average summer temperature around 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). If decide go South Pole instead, you’ll get even colder. The average summer temperature South Pole chilly -18 degrees Fahrenheit (-28 degrees Celsius). If make trip summer, another thing won’t see nighttime. In polar summer, Sun never sets."
"Crickets omnivores scavengers. They feed leaves, flowers, bark, seeds. Some species predatory, feeding insects, snails even small vertebrates snakes lizards. Field crickets eat variety fruits, vegetables, ornamental plants. They eat live dead insects, grasshopper eggs, pupae flies, moths butterflies. Sometimes steal prey spider webs. Spotted camel crickets come warm humid nights feed. They eat fungi, roots, fruit, dead insects, including crickets. Bush crickets eat leaves, flowers, fruits living plants. Ant-loving crickets eat ants’ young. Tree crickets feed aphids. Snowy tree crickets eat small insects. They also feed fruit crops apples peaches. If keeping cricket pet, eat fish food. Crickets also eat potatoes."
"Some moths lay eggs clothing. Others lay dry food, like flour rice. When eggs hatch, larvae eat clothing dried food. In way, larvae damaged crops, trees ornamental plants. Have ever found strange holes clothes? They might made hungry moth larva! Humans use mothballs keep moths clothing. Mothballs round, white balls treated chemicals poison moths. Since poison may also harm humans, balls never tasted eaten. You wash hands immediately touching mothballs. At time, moths also things help people. For example, moths help flowers grow pollinating them. The downside moths also lay eggs leaves plant. When eggs hatch caterpillars, munching plant begins! Have ever seen holes caterpillars make chew leaves plants?"
"At top stomach tube food comes esophagus. When swallow, tube opens food go stomach. The stomach made muscle. These muscles help break food mashing smaller pieces. The muscles also make waves pushing food digestive track. This called peristalsis happens esophagus way large intestine. The stomach lined glands. These special cells make liquid released stomach. This liquid called gastric juice. The gastric juice acid helps break digest food. The bottom part stomach called pyloric area. At bottom stomach another opening. This leads small intestine."
Eyes made several different parts. The white part eye called sclera.(It interesting note Human Species among creatures sclera visible eyes open). This part covers surface eyes except front. At front eye cornea. This part acts like shield eye. It still let light pass transparent. Under cornea iris pupil. The pupil black circle middle. It actually hole lets light pass back eye. The iris coloured diaphragm around pupil. It muscle opens closes around pupil let less light through. Behind pupil lens focuses light passes onto retina.
"The Sun’s light shines Earth. The light makes air, land, water warm. But things get warmer others. Pretend sunny day. If wore black shirt, would feel hot. But wore white shirt, wouldn’t feel hot. The dark color absorbs Sun’s energy. That makes black shirt warm. Light colors reflect Sun’s energy. This makes white shirt cooler wear. See yourself! You need piece black paper piece white paper. You also need two thermometers lamp. Ask adult help you. Fold black paper makes pocket. Do thing white paper. Next, put thermometer black pocket. Do thing white pocket. Then put pockets lamp. Turn lamp on, wait 10 minutes. Then check thermometers. Which pocket got hotter — black pocket white one? Do know why?"
"Have ever gone walk woods? If have, may seen colorful things growing tree trunks rocks. They look like plants, aren’t. They called lichens. Lichens made two living things: fungus alga. They live together help other. How living things help other? The alga makes food air water. The fungus protects alga growing around it. Lichens roots. They don’t need soil grow. They grow strange places—on rocks, cliffs, tree trunks. In Arctic Antarctica, lichens grow rocks. Lichens grow slowly. They grow cold temperatures. They even keep growing covered snow! Lichens tough. If lichen gets dry cold, might crumble blow away wind. But isn’t dead. When warmer wetter, lichen might start growing again. Lichens important. Caribou eat winter. People use make dyes medicines. Scientists study warn us pollution."
"Have heard Arctic? It place top world. Many animals live land water there. One animals arctic wolf. It wolf snowy white fur. Imagine wolf. What would life like? You would live mother, father, brothers sisters group. This group called pack. Other wolves would live pack, too. You would like play brothers sisters. This would teach hunt. Your pack would hunt together. You might hunt caribou, rabbits, musk oxen. Your life would hard. Hunting dangerous. You might able find food. Then would hungry. You would cold hungry winter. You would huddle wolves stay warm. But summer would different. There would plenty animals hunt. Then could sleep warm sunlight packmates. Zzzzz…"
"Near top world land called tundra. The tundra flat trees. It covered snow ice year. In spring, snow ice melt. Beneath ground, soil stays frozen. The ground gets soggy. It marsh. Small yellow flowers grow cold, wet ground. They called marsh marigolds. Flies hide flowers. They soak Sun’s energy get warm. The flies fly flower flower. They help flowers make seeds. Caribou eat flowers. The caribou also give plants nutrients need grow. Mother flies lay eggs inside caribou’s nose. It warm there. The young flies eat grow. The young flies get bigger. AH-CHOO! The caribou sneezes. The flies land ground. Soon, adults. These plants animals need other. Can think others?"
"When think dinosaurs lived, picture? Do see hot, steamy swamps, thick jungles, sunny plains? Dinosaurs lived places, yes. But know dinosaurs lived cold darkness near North South Poles? This surprised scientists, too. Paleontologists used believe dinosaurs lived warmest parts world. They thought dinosaurs could lived places turtles, crocodiles, snakes live today. Later, dinosaur scientists began finding bones surprising places. One surprising fossil beds place called Dinosaur Cove, Australia. One hundred million years ago, Australia connected Antarctica. Both continents located near South Pole. Today, paleontologists dig dinosaur fossils ground. They think ancient bones must mean."
"So solid? Solids usually hard molecules packed together. The closer molecules are, harder are. Solids also hold shape. A rock always look like rock unless something happens it. The goes diamond. Even grind solid powder, see tiny little pieces solid microscope. Liquids move fill container. Solids keep shape. In way solid holds shape, atoms inside solid allowed move around much. This one physical characteristics solids. Atoms molecules liquids gases bouncing floating around, free move want. The molecules solid stuck place. The atoms still spin electrons still fly around, entire atom change position."
"The second state matter discuss liquid. Solids hard things hold. Gases floating around bubbles. What liquid? Water liquid. Your blood liquid. Liquids in-between state matter. They found solid gas states. They made compounds. If variety materials liquid, called solution. One characteristic liquid fill shape container. If pour water cup, fill bottom cup first fill rest. The water also take shape cup. It fills bottom first gravity. The top part liquid usually flat surface. That flat surface gravity too. Putting ice cube (solid) cup leave cube middle cup; shape change ice becomes liquid."
"Solids shapes actually touch. They three dimensions, means length, width height. These shapes make daily life, useful. Points solid must coplanar colinear. The edge solids called edge, surfaces called faces. The corners, like angles plane figures, called vertices. A solid straight edges called polyhedron(pol-ee-HEE-dron). The plural form polehedron polyhedra(pol-ee-HEE-drah). Your chocolate bars polyhedra, The Great Pyramids polyhedra – lot things are. We go detail later. When dealing solid figures, two measurements need know: total surface area volume. The former sum faces solid; latter big solid is."
"Animals made many cells. They eat things digest inside. Most animals move. Only animals brains (though even animals do; jellyfish, example, brains). Animals found earth. They dig ground, swim oceans, fly sky. Humans type animal. So dogs, cats, cows, horses, frogs, fish, on. Animals divided two main groups, vertebrates invertebrates. Vertebrates divided mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians. Invertebrates divided arthropods (like insects, spiders, crabs), mollusks, sponges, several different kinds worms, jellyfish — quite subgroups. There least thirty kinds invertebrates, compared five kinds vertebrates. Vertebrates backbone, invertebrates not."
